##Use Version Control or Die:
For those of you that are vetrained programers you are probbally nodding along in agreement while those of you that have never writen a line of code are probablly scratching your heads and asking "what is version control"? Version control is like **Google Docs for your code**. It keeps track of everyline of code that is written, by whome and when. It even tracks a pretty little message with the code.

###Worst case scenerios:
I am not trying to scare you but you need to know how dire the consiquences of not using version control can be. Here are a couple of awful scenerios that can kill your venture dead.

####Programmer Turnover:
Lets say you use an outside contractor to set up your site or you hire your neighboors nephue and they do a great job building it then one day they decide to up and move on to do something else with their lifes. You go a head and hire someone else to make tweeks to your site what do you do when they ask you for the code so they can tweek it? 

If your lucky there is a live version of it running on the server somewhere but if its something that gets compiled like a mobile app then you are screwed.

####The fingure pointing game:
If you work with multiple programmers in succession or at the same time you might have people makeing changes to your application. If all of the suddon something dissapears or stops working(bugs do happen) using version control will help eliminate finger pointing between your programmers. It will be easy to see who made which change to the code, where and when. 

####Malicious Code:
This is your worst nightmare. Imagine a young frusterated programmer decides you are not paying them enough and decides to put in a couple of malicious lines of code in your app that will email him every credit card number that your customers put in... if you are not using version control then you have no record of who may have added the malicious code.

###How version control works:


###Services:

####Github:

####Bitbucket:

####SVN:

###Its more complex that this:
but this will eliminate 90% of your headaches.
