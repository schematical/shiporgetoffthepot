##Ship Or Get Off The Pot
###Thank you for checking out SOGOTP

###The writing process:
Writing a book has been one of the most monumentally challenging tasks I have attempted in my adult life. Especially considering I have always been considered naturally weak at reading and writing. With that in mind here are a couple of things to note:

####I am not a _naturally_ great writer!
I know this, trust me. The only way I can get better is by practicing and your feedback. This is that practice. You are watching the [10,000 hours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) unfold before your eyes. 

####Red lines slow me down:
I am easily distracted and a horrible speller. Writing using a tool like Microsoft Word seems to highlight every other word I write in red and it distracts me from whichever idea I am trying to express to you. This is why often times I will write out entire sections of SOGOTP or my posts using a _dumb_ text editor with no spell checking. 

I then go back after I have completed a draft and spell check it using Google Docs. Furthermore I will eventually need a very patient editor to go through and help me work out the final draft. 

For now the chances are better than not that you will stumble upon areas that are outlined and not even drafted yet or areas that are drafted but not in any way spell checked. Please be kinds and keep this in mind as you read this. I will try and make note of which areas have been spell checked in the outline or in each chapter.

####I play to my strengths:
I use the tools I am good at using. For example if you are reading this you are most likely checking it out via [Github](http://github.com) a programming tool. Not typically how people use to publish or gather feedback but it works for me. I am a [hacker](http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/yes-i-am-a-hacker-but-what-does-that-mean/?ref=sogotp), why fight it.

Also I use the old programming method of prefixing comments with '//'. Feel free to ignore these.

####I wouldn't call myself an 'expert'...yet:
If you don't know me(or even if you do) you might be asking the question: _Why are you writing a book on a topic you are not an expert on?_ 

How do experts become experts? 

* Through trial and error?
* Through hours and hours of research?
* Because people listen to them?

In the process of writing this book I am forced to do countless hours of research. Much of the trial and error has come from the past decade of being involved with startups but further more from exposing these topics to an audience and getting feedback, both positive and negative then using that to better craft my end product. And finally if you're reading this then it would seem that you are _listening_ to me because evidently I know something. Perhaps not an expert but it is a start.

###Intro Chapter:
With all that said please check out my intro chapter. It is meant to be the above the fold eye catcher. I have already iterated through a couple of drafts and this is my favorite so far.
