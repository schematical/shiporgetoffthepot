##Welcome to Stage 1: The Hackathon stage
If you are not already well aquainted with startup culture then you may have a negitive connotation of the word hacker. If this is your mindset then you may want to check out my article titled [Yes I am a Hacker but what does that mean (http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/yes-i-am-a-hacker-but-what-does-that-mean/)](http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/yes-i-am-a-hacker-but-what-does-that-mean/). 

###Hackathons are where startups are born:
I will admit not all startups are forged at hackathons, but alot are. Hackathons are great little events where people of varying ranges of talent get together and start building something amazing. On the other hand not everything built at hackathons are busines ideas. I remember one great hackathon at [Sector 67 in Madison](http://sector67.org) where some guy built one of those old timey bycles with the giant front wheel.

I use the term hackathon to discribe the initial sprint when you decide to find out if your idea is valid and could become a salable product. The key difference between this stage and the next is that in this stage you do not know if your idea is valid yet. 

I love hackathons because I love to build stuff, but sadly I have come to terms with the fact that not everything I build has potential to become a scalable product. It is a fact and you need to validate your idea.




This is what seperates the Hackathon stage from the Startup Stage.


##Personal Expirences:


###Round 1: FlipFlopSoft.com(Total flop)
Time to develop: 8 Months
Total Money Invested: $12K (My lifesavings back in 2007)
Total Profit: Less than $250 (Shoot me please)

This was one of my first legitimate attempts into the tech startup world. I was young and foolish. Though admitedly my sales and marketing abilities were non-existant at the time I still think the whole idea was not valid. Sure some people might be making some small margins providing similar services but keep the following in mind: 
* Gym Owners are small business owners and their fore are very price sensitive(cheap) so my margins were.. small 
* Because it was a tech product the Gym Owners(think of old school russians) required a lot of hand holding making my sales cycles long and cusomter service costs large.

###Round 2: TumbleScore.com(Not valid enough)
Time to develop: 2 weeks
Total money invested: $500
Total profit: $0

TumbleScore.com was another idea I had about 7 years later for a gymnastics score tracking system but this time I knew to validate and test my assumptions before going all in. The same issues as before pressisted. The big eye opener was when my friends that owned gyms were saying it was cool but slow to pick it up. Luckly I was able to learn all of these lessions in less than one month and for far cheaper than before.

###Round 3: HolidayHelper.io (Not running in the off season):
Time to develop: 3 evenings
Total Money Invested: $20
Total Profit: Around $100(//TODO: MATT CHECK THE NUMBERS)

HolidayHelper.io was an Amazon Affilate site I put up for kicks right around the holidays last year. I ran it for just a couple of days and wish I could have had it up and running in the weeks leading up to black friday. It had a 0 cost when it came to my personal time per sale and a very low overhead cost with moderate margins considering the cost. All in all worth running again. This year I will probablly set it back up and let it run with a small ad campaign.
 
###Other Examples:
I wish I could break down Schematical's indever into Facebook Applications as a Service but there are far to many variables to make a cause and effect argument using that as a case study.

I also would break down companies I consult with or have been CTO of but giving that kind of financial details I am sure would violate NDAs.




##Further Reading:
Great books have been written on the topic of validation. [The Lean Startup by Eric Rise](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=ride2shootcom-20&linkId=HZXDXFCI7LLQYMIZ) coined the term "validation" as it pertains to startups a couple of years back. 

[The Four Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307465357&linkCode=as2&tag=ride2shootcom-20&linkId=BPBNFBNAIFXXF3K2)

##What the Hackathon Stage is to you?
The Hackathon Stage is your chance to build an _Minimal Viable Product_ and test the assumptions you made when creating your Customer Aqusition Funnel(See more on this in !!Future Chaptors!!)

There are two important terms I just used:
####Minimal Viable Product:
The Minimal Viable Product(MVP) is an important concept to remember. It refers to minimum prototype you need to build to test the assumptians you have about your business, your product, and the market you intend to sell to.

####Customer Aqusition Funnel:
This is the process each customer will go through to purchas what you are selling. This is also commonly reffered to as a sales funnel. We will go over this more in the launch section.



##The Hackathon Stage for Intrepinures:
Intrepinures have it a little different then the run of the mill entrepinures. Intrepinures typically are trying to get an idea approved by the higher ups and wouldn't want to get caught spending company time working on an idea that has not been approved yet. This quickly becomes a chicken or the egg scenerio: If I don't work on the idea then I wont get approvial to work on the idea. This leaves the intrepinure asking "Should I wait for permission?". I am the type of guy to ask forgivness, not permission but you should use your best judgment. Ask your self:

* How much resources and time can you dedidcate to your idea before it starts noticably taking away from your other responsibilities?
* What are the consiquences of repurposing these resources and are they reversiable?
* Will the consiquences of my actions cause any one with a fancy title up the food chain to potentially look bad(often the most important indicator).

Use your head but personally I would rather not work for a company that punhises inovation and creation. Their reaction to my decision to dedicate resources to a new endevor would be an indicator to me as to wheither I would want to work there.

//TODO: INsert conclusion or remove this step












###OFF TANGENT NON-SENSE:

I am widly considered to be a hacker in the _"An expert at programming and solving problems with a computer"_ sense. But I would prefer to use another definition:

_Anyone that takes a look at a goal and a given set of resources then figures out an unconventional way to achieve that goal_.

This is far more encompasing. This allows me to be a growth hacker and do amazing things when it comes to marketing.
