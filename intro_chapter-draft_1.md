###It is time to _Ship Or Get Off The Pot_:
**//(What)**
//Problem
Do you have a million or potentially billion dollar idea? 

I have news for you: 
**There is no such thing as a "billion dollar idea", only billion dollar exicution.**

//NOTE: Might move this to the validation section.
Further more your idea as it stands today is most likly crap. 

Lets say you take your idea today write it down or carve it in stone. Then lock your self in a room with all of the right resources and a team of super intelegent genius interns pumped up on red bull and started to build your idea for the next 18 months. The expectation might be that on the first day of the 19th month you would pull back the curton and unvail your idea to the world. The entire world would bow down and hand you their hard earned cash for the end result of the idea you had slaved away on for the last 18 months.

//Solution
Locking your self away from the world in an effor to focus or to protect your idea from theft is a big mistake. It shields you from the outside world, it shields you from feedback. You need feedback. You need to make 1000 little mistakes to avoid making the entire project become one gigantic mistake. You can't hide from your mistakes, and some mistakes need to be made so that you can learn from them. Isolating your self or hiding your idea only post pones learning valuable lessions from your mistakes. Those lessions are vital to the process of launching anything, starting anything new. 

There have been thousands of entripinures before you that have taken chances, gotten knocked down, bruised and battered, then picked them selfs up, learn from their mistakes and got back to work figuring out a way to do it better. Luckily for you we can learn from their mistakes and side step potentially painful potholes in our journies. I am one of those bruised and battered entripinures that has taken a beating or 10 as I made my way in the entripinural world. Now inbetween ventures I make a living helping both large established and early stage high growth companies dodge those beatings and take their ideas from notes on a napkin to fully functional shippable products.

That is what Ship Or Get Off The Pot(SOGOTP) is. A summary of my, and many others, expirences intended to be your road map to shipping your idea.






 
//Why Ship: Safty/Security/Risk
In reality 18 months is nothing, people go their entire lifetime with their _'billion dollar ideas'_ never actually doing anything with them. Afraid to make those mistakes, both the little and the big, that are essential to going big.




###Who is this book for:
Originally when I started writing Ship Or Get Off The Pot I intended it for other bright eyed young hackers like myself. Guys that followed the rise of the sillicon Vally Greats and decided it was time to crack open a 2 liter of Mt. Dew and start coding.

As I have gotten older I have done more work with larger established companies struggling to try and to be less like Microsoft and more like Google. I call these people intrepinures. This book is for those intrepinures struggling to adapt and survive as new markets emerge and old markets dry up.

Finnally this book is for anyone just trying to start something new in this big and scary modern business landscape. Those just looking to hear how you can start with very little besides an idea and the notion that maybe, just maybe you could make something amazing happen.

###Why you should read this book:

###What this book covers:


###Who am I?
I am just a guy like you. A common colledge drop out, I dropped out to start company. A company I proceeded to drive straight into the ground and in the process lose my life savings on. From there I got lucky and some how managed to bounce back by niching myself as the Facebook guy for 6 of the top advertising agencies in Chicago. I built Facebook Apps for everyone from Vanity Fair to the Milwaukee Bucks. 

My success building Facebook Apps lead me to belive it was a good idea to invest my earnings into building a another company that helped others build Facebook Apps. Once again I locked myself away with a small team of developers I had hired and started to build. Once again I lost my life savings and brought myself to the brink of enhilation.

Repeativly submitting myself to such big risks which have had some serous consiquenses may sound like the actions of a crazy person. Perhaps, but each time I survived. Not only survived but thrived.
 
With my Facebook company I was able to turn it around and come back. I took a major failure and turned it into a company that sold a product with an (x) mark up.
