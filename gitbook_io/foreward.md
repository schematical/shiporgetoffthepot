# Foreward
When I started to write Ship Or Get Off The Pot I had a grandious vision for a book that encompused all things startup and tech related. Since then I have had 3 major revisions and a lot of good feedback. From this feedback I have decided to look at SOGOTP more like I would any system I have been tasked with Archetecting. I am going to try and widdle down SOGOTP to a smaller series of books that are more focused and easier to digest. This should allow me to iterate on SOGOTP faster, learn from your feedback faster and in the end _ship_ a better end product.

There are already plenty of books on Euntripinureship, leadership, marketing and so on. I decided that I will start with the topic that I will have the largest impact. Through my consulting with large established companies looking to innovate information on topic is in dire need. The topic:

How Large companies can survive and thrive in our ever changing business landscape by changing the fundemental way they structure their originiation, think of their business models.

I also intend to throw in a little bit on how to build technology that makes building and testing new ideas easier for every member of your team.
