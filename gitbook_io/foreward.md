# Foreword
When I started to write Ship Or Get Off The Pot I had a grandiose vision for a book that encompassed all things startup and tech related. Since then I have had 3 major revisions and a lot of good feedback. From this feedback I have decided to look at SOGOTP more like I would any system I have been tasked with architecting. I am going to widdle down SOGOTP to a smaller series of books that are more focused and easier to digest. This will allow me to iterate on SOGOTP faster, learn from your feedback faster and in the end _ship_ a better product.

There are already plenty of books on entrepreneurship, leadership, marketing and so on. I decided that I will start with the topic that I have the largest impact on. Through my consulting with large established companies looking to innovate like a startup I have found that information on this topic is in dire need. The topic:

**How large established organizations can apply startup methodology to be more responsive to the marketplace and survive the rapidly changing business landscape.**

I also have real world tips on how to build technology that makes building and testing new ideas easier for every member of your team.
