# Introduction
_In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment._
~[Charles Darwin](http://www.biographyonline.net/scientists/darwin-quotes.html)

The world moves faster than ever before. Industries are being flipped on their head one by one and companies in those industries are struggling to survive.

The early 2000nds flipped the music industry and took down thousands of brick and mortar music shops. The late 2000nds flipped the entertainment industry and crushed industry juggernaut Blockbuster Video.

The medical industry was just turned on its head by the recent changes in health care coverage. We will soon see which companies will survive and which will die. It is only a matter of time before your industry is subject to this volatility.

Who will survive? Will it be the large companies? Will their access to resources allow them to winter the the storm or will their massive overhead cause them to starve and perish?

History has taught us that those most adaptable to change will survive. Is your company ready to pivot or will you be stuck piloting the titanic into an iceberg because you are unable to correct course fast enough?

Typically large companies are not equipped to adapt to changes in the market. Why is that?

What kinds of organizations are better suited to survive and thrive in changing environments? During the music industries downfall you saw startups like Napster thrive and eventually make way for services like iTunes.

When the entertainment industry was changing and Blockbuster Video was being crushed underneath its own overhead services like Napster saw an opportunity and jumped on it.

How was Netflix able to execute on that change and Blockbuster unable to? Was it because Blockbuster was large and established? If so then how was Apple able to capitalize on iTunes?

Just because you are not a startup doesn't mean you can't be adaptable and innovative like one. Google and many other companies are proof of that. But what are the large organizations that survive doing to allow them to constantly stay on the cutting edge of the market?

No, I am not going to tell you to buy a foosball table an X-Box and start handing out free Red Bull to your employees so you can be more like a startup. That is all just lipstick on a pig, it takes a lot more than that to survive.

This book breaks down what the large established companies are doing.  Not just in a highly theoretical ivy league sense, but in a down and dirty men and women in the trenches executing sense.

##Who am I?
I am a startup junkie by nature and a software architect by trait.  I didn't grow up on the coasts, I grew up in Wisconsin. Up until recently no one in the midwest even knew what venture capital was. Those of us that didn't want to move to the coasts had to fight tooth and nail to get a foot hold for their startups. But that fight forced us to be resourceful and tenacious.

I am no Mark Zuckerburg. I have crashed and burned a few startups, mainly funded with my own money. Crashing a startup with your own money is a painful thing. Because it is so painful you learn a lot doing it.

Eventually as I got older because of my painful education large established companies stated to seek out my help to guide them away from making the same painful mistakes that I made when I was younger. Mistakes that if made on the scale that they are working on would cost millions.

##Who this book is for?
There are a lot of books on how to start a startup. This is not one of them. This is however on the lessons those in large established companies can learn from the military, the mafia, great craftsmen, and yes even startups.


##What is in this book?
In the first section we identify the weaknesses in the traditional hierarchical decision making process. Then we examine the ways the military and the mafia have devised tactics diverge from the traditional in order to survive in life or death situations. Tactics that most large business have not implemented because they are rarely in a life or death situation.

In the second section, Your Team, we examine how guerilla warfare can teach you to structure your workforce so that they can operate effectively and make smart battlefield decisions without waiting for the command.

We will also learn how to build a scalable workforce by examining the great craftsmen of old. Learning how they used aprintestes to handle their manual tasks so they could focus on the important things allowing them to be much more effective. While simultaneously teaching the future of the kingdoms workforce.

Finally since I am by trait a software architect and focus primarily on SaaS startups I will go into depth on how to structure a tech product so that your workforce is free to take the feedback they get while on the front line with your customer and build innovative new features without risking product quality or your brand's integrity.
