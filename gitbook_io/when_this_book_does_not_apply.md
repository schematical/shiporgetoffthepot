##When Autonomy Does Not Work:
The strategies I talk about in this book are NOT appropriate for every scenario. It is important you know when to apply these strategies and when not to.

##When you're scaling in a stable market:
If you have the secret recipe for success and are busy bottling and selling it to a steady stream of customers you are 100% sure will be there tomorrow to buy another bottle then you probably want your workforce focused on scaling up your production, not wasting resources trying new things.

###But...
You can never be 100% sure of anything. Eventually something will change and your product will either need to adapt or die. You might not want to apply these techniques today but the day will come when applying these techniques will pay off.

##Life or death situations:
My mother is a nurse. Every couple of years she has to study up to get her Advanced Life Support Certification. A small group of specialists have spent a lot of time determining the procedures that hundreds of thousands of caregivers use to save their patients. These processes are carefully reviewed and measured to ensure the best survival rate.

There is no need to adapt to rapid change since human biology not changing as quickly as the market.

###But...
Imagine a fairly new surgeon performing surgery on a patient. Something outside of the surgeon's control abruptly goes wrong. There is nothing in the manual about it. Time is running out. There is no time to get a second opinion from a more senior doctor. No action on the surgeon's part would mean certain death to the patient. The surgeon needs to be able to react according their best judgment.

Luckily were dealing with products and not peoples circulatory systems. I will talk about when and how to empower your high level technicians to make decisions on their own.

//TODO: I feel like there needs to be a 3rd one. I was going to use 'When you want your brand protected' but I pulled it out because it just didn't fit.

##Conclusion:
The techniques and strategies I use intended for companies looking to innovate and change. Most people fear change so I understand if you are hesitant to apply these tequniques. You need to understand that even if you don't want to change the market and your competitors are. You will need to change and survive. In order to keep up you will need to put trust in your people and empower them to innovate.
