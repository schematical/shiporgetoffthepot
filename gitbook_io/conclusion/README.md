###Focus:
If you don't want to give up control you had better keep your orginization lean and focus. Don't take on to many initiatives.

###Trust your people:
You started an orginization so you didn't have to be the only one doing everything otherwise that is just called consulting. You need to be able to build teams of people you can trust and can act on new ideas with out you holding their hands if you wish to survive in this market.

###Give them a process to try new things:
If you do want to take the gamble and see what happens when you put a bunch of passionate creative diciplined people in a room with some of your resources and let them have at it... outof brain cells

I tried to keep this book short and focused. In order to be truely effective in your quest to build an adaptive innovative business you will need to do a lot more research. Hopefully some of the books and resources I referenced will be as helpful to you as they have been to me.
