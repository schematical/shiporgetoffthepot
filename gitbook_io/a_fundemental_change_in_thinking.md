# A Fundamental Change in Thinking:
From my expirence consulting with large established companies that have been around for 50+ years it takes a fundemental change in thinking to survive. The very way you look at your business, your people, and how they work together will need to change. In this chapter we will go over how hiarchies have evolved to control large orginizations and how that is exactly what you need to give up if you want to survive, control.

##Innovation Today:
For our purposes here I am going to categorize the tech juggernauts into two categories. The Large Traditionally Structured Companies(the Microsofts) and the emerging new innovative companies(The Goggles).

Both types companies have grown past [Dunbar's Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number). Dunbar's Number is an approximation of the limit of the number of people one can maintain stable social relationships with. For your business this means the number of people that work at your company before there are complete strangers working for you.

Lets start out by examining the way the Traditionally Structured companies handel managing a workforce of this size.

##If you want control build hierarchy:
Think of the military, think of the kingdoms of old, even the Mafia. There was one person at the top and their small inner circle. Below them are a series of Generals or in business case C-Level directors(CMO, CTO, etc). Below them are the lieutenants or middle management. Below this level are the men(and women) in the trenches. The soldiers, the peasants, the street thugs.

//TODO: Diagram this hiarchy

These hierarchical based systems have evolved over the years to ensure one thing: **control** - Keep the men in line and all marching in the direction put forth by the guy on top.

This hierarchy isn't the worst thing, without some system it would just be anarchy and nothing would get accomplished. But if you happen to be the guy on top or even a lieutenant you have to understand that your view from the top helps you see the big picture, but the men in the trenches have the best view of what is really happening on the battlefield or in business's case, the market.

In a small business where its just you and one or two others you are in the trenches with your soldures. You are able to see and communicate with your team about the potential hazards on the battlefield(market). As you grow and your business expands in team size, in product lines, or in geographical proximity(bigger office or regional sales branches) this communication slows, it has to pass through more layers. Now feedback from your front line passes through the sergeant, to the lieutenant, to the general before it gets to you. This creates a game of telephone like the game we played as kids.

As communications flow up each level of the chain of command the message is adjusted based on each commander's bias and experiences. These alterations to the communication are not even intentional. By the time it reaches you its either watered down, altered or just plain inaccurate, not to mention by the time you get the message the opportunity to act on it was lost.

The technology is getting better. Two hundred years ago communication from the guys on the front line of your business took days or even months to get back to you. Now comunication gets to you in seconds via email or other digital delivery methods. With the cost of sending you a message at basically zero you have the opposite affect, and firehose of information to drink from. Once you reach a certain volume of information coming in it doesn't matter what your creative inbox management system looks like, there is no way you can keep up with every valuable piece of information. Things are going to fall through the cracks. The bigger your organization gets the more things you will miss.

###Real Business Examples:
Lets look at some real life scenarios of communication that those on the frontline see long before it reaches you.

The airline stewardess that notices no one uses their in seat entertainment systems because everyone has a tablet or mobile device and that the outdated screen is more of annoyance to those customers looking to catch some sleep.

The sales rep that, while getting turned down on a potential sale, hears about a new competitor in the market that is quietly taking market share in your market.

The junior developer that hears of a new technology that would save thousands of hours of development time over the next 5 years if applied.

In Richard Branson's Book Barenaked Business(//TODO: Find real title) he even talks about how one of his biggest mistakes was not to sell of his Virgin Megastore's during the rise of Napster. I doubt he would have made that mistake if he had been behind the cash register counting the the receipts, or lack there of.

At the same time Steve Jobs, notorious for sticking his nose is even the lowest level employees business, was building iTunes and beating everyone else to the digital download revolution. //TODO: Maybe come back to this later
//Idea: Do less vs Control Less - Focus is always good, but a necessity in early stages.


####The military and the mafia
In the military the chances of the men in the trenches having their communication cut off while in the field is pretty high. Because of that they had to adapt and give up some control. Large standing forces do this with what is called 'Commanders Intent'. The lieutenant says "Take that hill by approaching it from the south and flanking it along the hill to the east". Now what happens if the hill to the east is being bombarded by artillery and communications are cut off, would you still want your men mindlessly marching up the hill to certain death like lemmings? No this is why militaries throughout history have utilized **Commanders Intent**. The lieutenant may have looked at all available information at the time and decided the best strategy was the one outlined above but  in case this strategy is no longer feasible then understand that the intent of the order was to "take the hill via any means possible". This allows the troops on the ground a little autonomy.

The Mafia has had to develop similar techniques due to the fact communication is often cut off by the authorities.  Their fore the Don's have to surrender some control by allowing their lieutenants to make their own decisions with the Commander's Intent being **"Make me a lot of money without getting me arrested or whacked"**

The businesses I refer to as the Microsofts often have the same hierarchies but since no one is trying to blow them up or throw them in jail they typically they have not had to adapt the same survival traits mentioned above. They never give up control.

//TODO: Come back to Military example as an extreme with Guerrilla Warfare and that is how far google took it.


##Paint by Number Mentality:
Since hiring and training a huge team of employees is a complex and difficult task the middle and senior management often times draft incredibly long textbooks and training materials that each employee must follow in order to do their jobs.

While a certain amount of documentation is a very good thing, if you over document and tell the employees how to do every detail of their job then you decrease their creativity and likeness
 to solve problems on their own in a creative way. This is an innovation killer. Often times you, and senior management, might walk in to a meeting with your employees and see that there is some really obvious problem going on and when you ask why no one has fixed it their reply will be "because there was nothing in the manual about it".

Completely top down documentation is not a good thing either. I mean the manuals created by the lieutenants far away from the front line of your business. Or worse yet some harvard grad middle management that has never even seen the front line.

Now don't get me wrong, if you have ever read [The Checklist Manifesto](//TODO: Put this link in) then you know the importances of checklists in certain life or death settings. But if no one's life is on the line is it really necessary?

Giving your employees a 1,2,3 process and punishing them for stepping outside of the processes set forth is a sure way to instill the uncreative paint by numbers approach that kills innovation. Not to mention that it show how little you trust to think for themselves those in your command which is a huge moral killer.

###What you get if you don't give up a little control:
In the end you get a work force of uncreative individuals that are afraid to go above and beyond and step outside of the processes you set forth. That if ordered to take the hill via going through the ravine and the ravine was being bombarded would march right in to the enemy fire then figure out a smarter way to take the hill.

You end up with the most senior level people the only ones with the authority to make decisions. Worse yet they are making decisions on information that first has to make the timely journey through your hierarchical game of adult telephone causing important information to arrive inaccurate and too late to act on.





##The New Companies:
This books is about how modern companies are changing how they are structured, how they treat their team members(a term I would much rather use than employees), their customers, and the way they charge for goods and services.

##When Autonomy Does Not Work:
Life or death situations

//Nurses and avg joes

//Super High Level Technicians

##//Something about me not being an idealist and working in the trenches of the real world
