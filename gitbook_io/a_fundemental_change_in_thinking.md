# A Fundemental Change in Thinking:




##Innovation Today:
For our purposes here I am going to catigorize the tech jugarnauts into two catigories. The Large Traditionaly Structured Companies(the Microsofts) and the emerging new innovation companies(The Googles).

Both types companies have grown past [Dunbar's Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number). Dunbar's Number for those of you that don't know is an aporximation of the limit of the number of people one can maintain stable social relationships with. For your business this means the number of people that work at your company before there are complete strangers working for you.

Lets start out by examining the way the Traditionally Structured companies handel managing a workforce of this size.

##If you want control build hiarchy:
Think of the military, think of the kingdoms of old, even the Mafia. There was one person at the top and their small brain trust. Below them are a series of Generals or in business case C-Level directors(CMO, CTO, etc). Below them are the lutenents or middle managment. Below this level are the men(and women) in the trenches. The solders, the pesants, the street thugs.

These hiarical based systems have evolved over the years to ensure one thing: **control** - Keep the men in line and all marching in the direction put forth by the guy up top.
This hiarchy isn't the worst thing, without some system it would just be anarchy and nothing would get acomplished. But if you happen to be the guy up top or even a lutenent you have to understand that your view from the top helps you see the big picture stuff, but the men in the trenches have the best view of what is really happening on the battlefield or in business's case, the market.

In a small business where its just you and one or two others you are in the trenches. You are able to see and communicate with your team about the potential hazards on the battlefield(market). As you grow and your team expands both in number, in product lines, or in geographical proximity(bigger office or regional sales branches) this communication slows, it has to pass through more layers. Now feedback from your front line passes through the sergeant, to the lieutenant, to the general before it gets to you. This creates a game of telephone like what we used to play as a kid. As communications flow up the chain of command each level the message is adjusted based on each commander's bias and experiences. By the time it reaches you its either watered down, altered or just plain inaccurate, not to mention by the time you get the message the opportunity to act on it was lost.

The technology is getting better. 100 years ago communication from the guys on the front line of your busienss took days or even months to get back to you can get to you in seconds via email or other digital deliver methods. Now with the cost of sending you a message at basically zero you have the opposite affect, and firehose of information to drink from. Once you reach a certain volume of information coming in I don't care what your creative inbox managment system looks like, there is no way you can keep up with every valuable peace of information. Things are going to fall through the cracks, the bigger your orginization gets, the more things you will miss.



Lets look at some real life scenerios of communications

The airline stewardess that notices no one uses their in seat entertainment systems because everyone has a tablet or mobile device and that the outdated screen is more of annoyance to those customers looking to catch some sleep.

The sales rep that, while getting turned down on a potential sale, hears about a new competitor in the market that is quietly taking market share in your market.

The junior developer that hears of a new technology that would save thousands of hours of development time over the next 5 years if applied.

In Richard Branson's Book Bare Naked Business(//TODO: Find real titile) he even talks about how one of his biggest mistakes was not to sell of his Virgin Megastore's during the rise of Napster. I doubt he would have made that mistake if he had been behind the cash register counting the the receipts, or lack there of.

At the same time Steve Jobs, notorious for sticking his nose is even the lowest level employees business, was building iTunes and beating everyone else to the digital download revolution. //TODO: Maybe come back to this later
//Idea: Do less vs Control Less - Focus is always good, but a necissity in early stages.


####The military and the mafia
In the military the chances of the men in the trenches having their communication cut off while in the field is pretty high. Because of that they had to adapt and give up some control. Larger standing forces do this with what is called 'Commanders Intent'. The lutenent says "Take that hill by approching it from the south and flanking it along the hill to the east". Now what happens if the hill to the east is being bombarded by artillery and communications are cut off, would you still want your men mindlessly marching up the hill to certain death like lemmings? No this is why militaries throughout history have utilized **Commanders Intent**. The lutenent may have looked at all available information at the time and decided the best strategy was the one outlined above but  in case this strategy is no longer feasible then understand that the intent of the order was to "take the hill via any means possible". This allows the troops on the ground a little autonomy.

The Mafia has had to develop similar techniques due to the fact communication is often cut off by the authorities.  Their fore the Don's have to surrendor some control by allowing their lutenents to make their own decisions with the Commander's Intent being **"Make me a lot of money without getting me arrested or whacked"**

The businesses I refer to as the Microsofts often have the same hiarchies but since no one is trying to blow them up or throw them in jail they typically they have not had to adapt the same survival traits mentioned above. They never give up control.

//TODO: Come back to Military example as an extreame with Gurilla War fare and that is how far google took it.


##Paint by Number Mentality:
Since hiring and trainging a huge team of employees is a complex and difficult task the middle and senior managment often times draft increadibly long textbooks and training materials that each employee must follow in order to do their jobs.

While a certain amount of documentation is a very good thing, if you over document and tell the employees how to do every detail of their job then you decrease their creativity and likelyness
 to solve problems on their own in a creative way. This is an innovation killer. Often times you, and senior managment, might walk in to a meeting with your employees and see that there is some really obvious problem going on and when you ask why no one has fixed it their reply will be "because there was nothing in the manual about it".

Completely top down documentation is not a good thing either. I mean the mannuals created by the lutenents far a way from the front line of your business. Or worse yet some harvord grad middle managment that has never even seen the front line.

Now don't get me wrong, if you have ever read [The Checklist Manafesto](//TODO: Put this link in) then you know the importances of check lists in certain life or death settings. But if no one's life is on the line is it really neccisary?

Giving your employees a 1,2,3 process and punishing them for steping outside of the processes set forth is a sure way to instill the uncreative paint by numbers approch that kills innovation. Not to mention that it show how little you trust to think for them selves those in your command which is a huge moral killer.

###What you get if you don't give up a little control:
In the end you get a work force of uncreative individuals that are afraid to go above and beyond and step outside of the proccesses you set forth. That if orded to take the hill via going through the revine and the revine was being bombarded would march right in to the enemy fire then figure out a smarter way to take the hill.

You end up with the most senior level people the only ones with the authroity to make decisions. Worse yet they are making decisions on information that first has to make the timly journey through your hiarchial game of adult telephone causing important information to arrive innaccurate andto late to act on.





##The New Companies:
This books is about how modern companies are changing how they are structured, how they treat their team members(a term I would much rather use than employees), their customers, and the way they charge for goods and services.
