# A Fundamental Change in Thinking:
From my expirence consulting with large established companies that have been around for 50+ years it takes a fundemental change in thinking to survive. The very way you look at your business, your people, and how they work together will need to change. In this chapter we will go over how hiarchies have evolved to control large orginizations and how these same hiarchies pose a threat to your ability to adapt and survive in the market today.

##The Military, The Mafia and the Kindoms of old:
Think of the military, think of the kingdoms of old, even the Mafia. There was one person at the top and their small inner circle. Below them are a series of Generals. In modern business's case this would be the C-Level directors(CMO, CTO, etc). Below them are the lieutenants or middle management. Below this level are the men(and women) in the trenches. The soldiers, the peasants, the street thugs.

//TODO: Diagram this hiarchy

These hierarchical based systems have evolved over the years to ensure one thing: **control** - Keep the men in line and all marching in the direction put forth by the guy on top.

This hierarchy isn't the worst thing. Without some system it would just be anarchy and nothing would get accomplished. Though the guy on top's view from the top helps them see the big picture the men in the trenches have the best view of what is really happening on the battlefield or in business's case, the market.

In a small business where its just you and one or two others you are in the trenches with your soldures. You are able to see and communicate with your team about the potential hazards on the battlefield(market). As you grow and your business expands in team size, in product lines, or in geographical proximity(bigger office or regional sales branches) this communication slows; it has to pass through more layers. Feedback from your front line passes through the sergeant, to the lieutenant, to the general before it gets to you. This creates a game of telephone like the game we played as kids.

As communications flow up each level of the chain of command the message is adjusted based on each commander's bias and experiences. These alterations to the communication are not even intentional. By the time it reaches you its either watered down, altered or just plain inaccurate. Additionally by the time you get the message the opportunity to act on it was lost.

The technology is getting better. Two hundred years ago communication from the guys on the front line of your business took days or even months to get back to you. Now comunication gets to you in seconds via email or other digital delivery methods. With the cost of sending you a message at basically zero you have the opposite affect, and firehose of information to drink from. Once you reach a certain volume of information coming in it doesn't matter what your creative inbox management system looks like, there is no way you can keep up with every valuable piece of information. Things are going to fall through the cracks. The bigger your organization gets the more things you will miss.

###Real Business Examples:
Lets look at some real life scenarios of communication that those on the frontline see long before it reaches you.

The airline stewardess that notices passengers do not use their in seat entertainment systems because everyone has a tablet or mobile device. The outdated screen is more of annoyance to those customers looking to catch some sleep.

The sales rep that, while getting turned down on a potential sale, hears about a new competitor in the market that is quietly taking market share in your market.

The junior developer that hears of a new technology that would save thousands of hours of development time over the next 5 years if applied.

##Acting on this information:
Assuming this information makes its way up the chain of comand and to your desk how long will it take you to change the course of the ship? Changing the corse of a large company with 1000 or more people is not a simple task. The actions you as the leader decide on will need to be communicated to your generals, who then will communicate them to their lutenentes and so on. The change in direction will undoubtly raise many new questions that will make their way back through the same channels all the while time is still passing and you are losing market share.

##Conclusion:
Weather you want to belive it or not if you are in a leadership position you need to face facts. There is key information that your people on the front lines can see that you cannot from your position in the company. This information might, just might, make its way to you through the hiarchial game of telephone. Are you willing to gamble that it will make it in time for you to do anything about it?
