# 1.5 Shared vision
I know I have been telling you to split your orginization down into peaces and let them go about their business building your empire but something has to be the glue that holds them together. That glue is a shared purpose.

I have said that we as a species are community based. We are happier when we feel like we are part of something. That might be something as small as a five person group. That community might be as large as a country. Think back to the last chapter with the American Revioultionists. It wasn't trying to hold the hill that united the batallion, or even killing redcoats, it was the vision that they would oneday be freemen with no king to tell them what to do that kept them all fighting the same war.

There is story I have been told about NASA when we were first trying to send a man to the moon. JFK was touring NASA for an update talking to all of the high profile scientists, pilots and politicians when he came across a janitor cleaning. The janitor was vigoursly cleaning as if his life depended on it. The president stoped him and asked "What are you doing?". To which the janitor repied "Helping put a man on the moon".

It is important that every person in your orginization shares your vision and feels like they are a part of it. Again I could go on and on about leadership and the importance of it but I will save that for another book.

What is your cause? Is your company only here to make money? That vision works for thousands of Wall street companies or are you trying to change the world? You might argue that every business is out to make money and to be realistic this is true but is that all they are doing or is money a means to an end? If so what is that end?
