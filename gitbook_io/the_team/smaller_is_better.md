#It takes a team:
It is rare that one person can truely be effective in delivering change across a large scale. Though through out history there may have been a single front man on stage in the spotlight but I assure you there is always a solid support team behind them.


##Benifits of small teams:
Please don't call homeland security on me for this next part but I would like to take a lession from those that have praticed Guerilla Warfare for years and years. Guerella Warfare is not always the most effective way to fight. Some times marching 1000 men shoulder to shoulder might be the most effecent way to win a battle. That is how wars were thought for thousands of years all the way up to the american revolution when we were outnumbered and out gunned so we split our forces into smaller divisions that hid in the woods.

The revolutionaries wernt given step by step orders orders like march across delaware to the south over this hill and around this revine then battle the red coats head on. Instead they were tought stratigies and techniques then sent out to exicute these order atonomosouly. Stratigies like find and cut off the enimies supply train. Techniques such as how to hide in the woods and exicute an ambush.

###Focus:
For our above mentioned example the general would have picked a specific batilaion of men and told them to hold the western front via any means necissary. He would then send another batillaion of men with the intent of taking a city to the east. Each batillion could be much more efficiant because their attention was not split between the two activities.

If you have a large orginization with many different objectives then it becomes easy to lose focus. Decisions like should I work on Objective A, B, or C today become difficult.

If you are on a team whos sole focus is clearly one objectives then it makes it easy to focus and make decisions.Not to mention the mental penitaly you pay each time you shift tasks.

###Communication:
The smaller the team the closer the decision makers on the team are to the front line. Every link you can remove from that hiarchial game of human telephone brings your decisions makers that much closer to being able to make important realtime decisions.


###Reaction Speed:
The smaller the team the fewer people that need to be wrangled for meetings. Fewer people that need to approve decisions that will determine the fate of your project. It the beuracratic pratice of wrangling and waiting for approvial that burns the most amount of time and leave your business behind the rest of the market.

Part of the reason startups are flying past you is it is easy to get approvial when your just three guys in a dorm. "Should I build this dude?" - "Yeah that would be cool".


###Accountability:
The smaller the team the less people there are to point fingures at when the $&*% hits the fan. People will have to take responsibility for their own actions and those that they supervise. No more "well if the guys over in accounting had gotten us those numbers...". Its your team, its your ass.
