##Benifits of small teams(new title you get the idea)

//guerilla war fare

##Anatomy of a team:
//TODO: we need a section on 'architects' or 'director' level positions

//Make the archtypes in this section based off of the last section

###What is a 'Technician'?
I use the word Technician a lot in my writing. I intend to use it in the Michael Gerber's [The E-Myth](..) Sense. The E-Myth is an amaizing book written about how to scale your orginization in a traditional sense. Michael breaks down individuals roles in an orginization into one of 3 types:
* The Euntripinure
* The Manager
* The Technician

The Technician is the guy doing the work that you are billing for. This could be a bus boy or a doctor. If they are not managing others or planing out the next stratigic move then chances are they are a Technician. If you haven't checkout the EMyth I strongly suggest you do.

But no one likes being policed either

You can offer different levels of autonomy depending on the person
