#It takes a team:
It is rare that one person can truely be effective in delivering change across a large scale. Though through out history there may have been a single front man on stage in the spotlight but I assure you there is always a solid support team behind them.


##Benifits of small teams:
Please don't call homeland security on me for this next part but I would like to take a lession from those that have praticed Guerilla Warfare for years and years. Guerella Warfare is not always the most effective way to fight. Some times marching 1000 men shoulder to shoulder might be the most effecent way to win a battle. That is how wars were thought for thousands of years all the way up to the american revolution when we were outnumbered and out gunned so we split our forces into smaller divisions that hid in the woods.

The revolutionaries wernt given step by step orders orders like march across delaware to the south over this hill and around this revine then battle the red coats head on. Instead they were tought stratigies and techniques then sent out to exicute these order atonomosouly. Stratigies like find and cut off the enimies supply train. Techniques such as how to hide in the woods and exicute an ambush.

###Focus:
For our above mentioned example the general would have picked a specific batilaion of men and told them to hold the western front via any means necissary. He would then send another batillaion of men with the intent of taking a city to the east. Each batillion could be much more efficiant because their attention was not split between the two activities.

If you have a large orginization with many different objectives then it becomes easy to lose focus. Decisions like should I work on Objective A, B, or C today become difficult.

If you are on a team whos sole focus is clearly one objectives then it makes it easy to focus and make decisions.Not to mention the mental penitaly you pay each time you shift tasks.

###Communication:
The smaller the team the closer the decision makers on the team are to the front line. Every link you can remove from that hiarchial game of human telephone brings your decisions makers that much closer to being able to make important realtime decisions.


###Reaction Speed:
The smaller the team the fewer people that need to be wrangled for meetings. Fewer people that need to approve decisions that will determine the fate of your project. It the beuracratic pratice of wrangling and waiting for approvial that burns the most amount of time and leave your business behind the rest of the market.

Part of the reason startups are flying past you is it is easy to get approvial when your just three guys in a dorm. "Should I build this dude?" - "Yeah that would be cool".


###Accountability:
The smaller the team the less people there are to point fingures at when the $&*% hits the fan. People will have to take responsibility for their own actions and those that they supervise. No more "well if the guys over in accounting had gotten us those numbers...". Its your team, its your ass.



##Anatomy of a team:
//Variety is important
What is a sniper with out a spotter to ensure there are no dangers out side of the snipers scope? Or an airforce with out an army to protect its planes while they are refuling?

Effective teams are made up of a variety of skillsets, personalities and levels of skill. We will cover why the variety of levels of expirence is important in the next chaptor. Here I want to talk about the need for a variety of skills and personalities.

##Personality Types:
###Visionarys vs Exicuters:
Recently I was able to observe this in action in a small healthcare startup founded by two men. I will just call them the visionary and the exicuter. People in our comunity were critical of the visionary accusing him of benifiting off of the work of the exicutioner. This may have been true in a way but at the same time I know some employees that only took the job because they belived in the visionarys vision. The visionary was also contantly trying to expand and innovate the services they offered while the exicutioner was trying to stay focued on fortifying their existing revinue streams. Which was the right stratigy? The truth is probabbly a little bit of both.

This is a common division in startups. The visionaries Steve Jobs, and the exicuters, Steve Waziniack. Would Jobs have been able to build the foundation of the apple empire without Waz there to build the products? Would Waz have been able to sell his brilliant hardware designs with out Jobs' charisma and vision? Would Waz have even had the vision to see the possibilities? It is a chicken and the egg scenerio.

##Realists vs Optimasts:
In the previous chapter I talked about some traits that you should look for in your intrepinures.

//TODO: Might remove this section ^^^ or finish it

##Skills:
Not to get corny but do you remember the A-Team... yeah its kinda like that. Imagine if you had a team of all BA Baracus all running around acting the tough guy or all Faces fighting over the girl. I can only imagine what a team of Murdocks would acomplish.

The small teams inside of your orginization I am recomending need to have the same cross section of skills.

//TODO: insert gymnastics camp example
//Event specialists -

###Anatomy of a tech team:
Since I mainly deal in tech startups I will use this as my example but I don't care if you run a bakery, a gymnastics gym, or a summercamp small teams of cross dicipline teams are much more adept to react to situations as they come up compaired with large silos of people.



####Designers:
There are many types of designers, check my blog for more detailed write ups on what each one does but you will most likely need a nice cross section of User Expirence, User Interface, Product, and Graphic designers to get the job done. Designers take a top down approch to building the product looking at what the customer needs first.


####Engineers:
Engineers take a bottom up approch to building the product. They look at your resouces and figure out how to make your product work.

####Marketing/Sales People:
These people are responsible for getting it out to the masses. They equally are responsible for getting feedback on it. One way shout it out markeing is dead, in reality it never really existed. You always get feedback on your product in the form of paying customers or lack there of. No paying customers equals bad feedback. Both marketers and sales people are responsible for shouting out about your product as well as listening. In reality every team member is but these guys specialize in it a little more.

####Project Manager:
This person makes sure everyone is on the same page. Communication, scheduling and timelines, etc. This person is not the 'boss'. This person is a resource. This person bridges communication, orginizes timelines with the feedback of the designers and engineers.


####Project Owner:
Were missing one thing though, who is incharge? Remember shit rolls up hill. If something isn't going to plan or someone isn't doing their job who is responsible to catch that awful smelling snowball before it reaches you? The project owner.

This could be any of the above designers, engineers, marketing/sales people, or project managers. It is up to you to determine who you can trust with such responsibility. Maybe it is the junior level employee that came to you pitching a new idea for a revinue stream. Maybe it is a veterned employee that you pair with that junior level employee to keep them on track.

Use your best judgment. I could go on and on about leadership but I will save that for another book. For now understand that two things:

#####They need to be a leader:
This person needs to be more than a boss; They need to be a leader. There is a big difference. Check out my post [Are you a Boss or a Leader](http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/are-you-a-boss-or-a-leader/) on [shiporgetoffthepot.com](shiporgetoffthepot.com).

#####They need to be ready to take responsibilty:
If the project fails weather it is market conditions, bad decisions or act of god, the project owner needs to be able to take responsibility for it. The weight is on their shoulders. They need to honestly be able to communicate the teams failures to you in a timly fashion. Don't be too hard on them, rembember it is you, the CEO that put them in charge so their failure is yours as well.

##Conclusion:
If you want to innovate you need to be able to change direction in an instant. Maybe not your whole orginization but definitly those you task with innovating need to be ready. Small cross dicipline teams are best suited to manuver.



 across your varying teams.
