# Taking Teams to a whole new level(invest, not aquire)
Some of the big tech giants are taking this seperate teams thing to a whole new level. They are opening up venture funds or business incubators. This means they are investing money into ideas and teams they won't fully own nor control.

Check out [https://www.gv.com/](https://www.gv.com/). This is Google Ventures site. Microsoft seems to have gotten the message as well: [http://www.microsoftventures.com/](http://www.microsoftventures.com/). Other Tech Giants are [throwing in together](http://www.inc.com/news/articles/2010/10/facebook-amazon-team-up-for-venture-fund.html) to build venture funds to invest in 3rd party ideas.


Even once the idea takes off and they might aquire the technology they don't try and strip apart the aquired company like what would have happened in the 80s. Instead the offer it more resources, ensure their visions match up, probablly do some stratigic partnering but that is it. Look at Google's aqusition of Next. So far there has been no sign that they have any plan to change Next to 'The Google Thermostat'.

##Conclusion:
I would be lieing if I said tech were the original pioneers on this. It has been done before. I'm just trying to show you how much control the big guys are giving up and how much success they are having. Do you have the guts to allow your teams to function as their own running businesses? You might have to if you want to be on the cutting edge of innovation.
