# What is an intrepinure:
I am not trying to insult your creativity or ability to innovate, but lets face it your human. You have limitations. Your mental bandwidth is probablly spread thin running the company as it stands today without taking the initiative to build something new and innovative.

Even if you could take on one new endevior with half your mental capacity then your still half focused. What if you have some one managing the business and you are fully focused on innovating a new product or service? Why not hedge your bets? The most cutting edge companies are but putting a little trust and investing in some key intrepinures.

It is your job to search out and find these intrepinures that are fresh and ready to take on a challenge. Then put them to work inventing whatever comes next.

An intrepinure is someone that you can give a little atonomy to. You can hand them a problem and say "Fix it" or "Find a better cheaper way to do it than our competitors" and they will run off with a small amount of your resources and come back with an amazing solution you couldn't have dreamed up in a million years.


###Not everyone is cut out to be an intrepinure:
I don't want to blow smoke up you hat, or misslead you to beliving that everyone is cut out to be in intrepinure. Some people are just trying to make a quick buck. I wouldn't recomend even hiring those people much less give them atonomy to operate on behalf of your orginization.

This section is NOT about what makes a good employee. Your best employees are mostl likely increadibly talented, able to hit deadlines, and dedicated as all hell. I am not downing on great employees.

I am trying to help you identify the traits you should be looking for to find those in your orginization that make great intrepinures. And how they fit into the innovation process.


###Passionate:
Passion is the number one thing I look for when hiring especially at an early stage. Like they say "Talent is overrated"~Geoffrey Colvin. I have seen passionate people perform miricals because they were so thrilled just to be there working on something they loved doing even though the pay wasn't much.

When I start talking about NodeJS or Angular and I see their eyes light up like a kid in a candy store then I know I have the right developer. When I start walking a canidate through our growth stratigy and before they are hiried they start throuwing out suggestions and ideas I know I have the right marketing person.

If you throw out an idea and they run with it then you know you have the right people. These people are important because they don't know what they can't do. The funny thing is not knowing those limitations they often times do what others think is impossible.

##Resourcefullness:

Great intrepinures shouldn't gripe if you give them a tight deadline and 1/3 of the resources they ask for. They

##Creativity:


####Real World Tip:
Passion is not everything though, just like talent isn't everything. The ability to hit a deadline is increadibly important. I often times assign a little homework to my developers. No, not some beurocratic standerdized test. I give them a list of technologies that we use ,ordered by easiest to master too most difficult.  Then I ask them to take the weekend to build anything. Build a website, a mobile app that beeps at me, pretty much any deliverable will do. Bonus points if the can deliver it to me via github. This helps me see who has the follow through to deliver.

This also helps me gauge their creativity and resourcefullness. You would be amazed how many people when not given step by step paint by the numbers instructions panic and freeze like deer in the headlights. This doesn't mean that they are not great employees, but it does mean that they probablly won't make great intrepinures. You wouldn't want to send them off to invent a new revinue stream for your company.
