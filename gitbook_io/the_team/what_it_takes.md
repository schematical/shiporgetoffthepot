# What it takes

<!--This section is about what it on an individual level and what qualities I look for such as:

* Passion - Not the only thing but, yes, the first thing I look for.
* Trust - It goes both ways
* Dicipline - Helps trust-->

In this section we will cover the different types of people in your originization.

* The young and passionate but inexpirecnced.
* The expireneced vetrans that share your vision but aren't on the cutting edge
* Those just trying to make a quick buck
* The expert technicians

###What is a 'Technician'?
I use the word Technician a lot in my writing. I intend to use it in the Michael Gerber's [The E-Myth](..) Sense. The E-Myth is an amaizing book written about how to scale your orginization in a traditional sense. Michael breaks down individuals roles in an orginization into one of 3 types:
* The Euntripinure
* The Manager
* The Technician

The Technician is the guy doing the work that you are billing for. This could be a bus boy or a doctor. If they are not managing others or planing out the next stratigic move then chances are they are a Technician. If you haven't checkout the EMyth I strongly suggest you do.

###Not everyone is cut out to be an intrepinure:
I don't want to blow smoke up you hat, or misslead you to beliving that everyone is cut out to be in intrepinure. Some people are just trying to make a quick buck. I wouldn't recomend even hiring those people much less give them atonomy to operate on behalf of your orginization.

This section helps identify several archtypes and how they fit into the innovation process.

###The young and passionate:
Passion is the number one thing I look for when hiring especially at an early stage. Like they say "Talent is overrated"~Geoffrey Colvin. I have seen passionate people perform miricals because they were so thrilled just to be there working on something they loved doing even though the pay wasn't much.

When I start talking about NodeJS or Angular and I see their eyes light up like a kid in a candy store then I know I have the right developer. When I start walking a canidate through our growth stratigy and before they are hiried they start throuwing out suggestions and ideas I know I have the right marketing person.

If you throw out an idea and they run with it then you know you have the right people.

These people are important because they don't know what they can't do.

//Example KHai, Robbie

####Real World Tip:
Passion is not everything though, just like talent isn't everything. The ability to hit a deadline is increadibly important. I often times assign a little homework to my developers. No, not some beurocratic standerdized test.

I give them a list of technologies that we use, in order of easiest to master to most difficult, and I ask them to take the weekend and build anything. Build a website, a mobile app that beeps at me, pretty much any deliverable will do. Bonus points if the can deliver it to me via github.

This helps me see who has the follow through to deliver, well... anything. You would be amazed how many people when not given step by step paint by the numbers instructions panic and freeze like deer in the headlights. This doesn't mean that they are not great employees, but it does mean that they probablly won't make great intrepinures and you wouldn't want to send them off to create a new revinue stream for your company.

###The veterans



But no one likes being policed either

You can offer different levels of autonomy depending on the person


High level technicians/Architect level
