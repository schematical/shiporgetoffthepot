# What is an intrepinure:
//TODO: Insert big focus on 'ask forgivness not permission'
I am not trying to insult your creativity or ability to innovate, but lets face it your human. You have limitations. Your mental bandwidth is probablly spread thin running your business as it stands today without taking the initiative to build something new and innovative.

Even if you could take on one new endevior with half your mental capacity then your still half focused. What if you have some one managing the business and you are fully focused on innovating a new product or service? Why not hedge your bets? Why trust your workforce  effectivly turing them in to **intrepinures**.

It is no longer your job to come up with all of the big ideas. It is your job to search out and find these intrepinures that are fresh and ready to take on a challenge. Then put them to work inventing the next bit thing in your industury.

###What is an intrepinure?
Intrepinure are the ones you should be ginving atonomy to. You can hand them a problem and say "Fix it" or "Find a better cheaper way to do it than our competitors" and they will run off with a small amount of your resources and come back with an amazing solution you couldn't have dreamed up in a million years.


###Not everyone is cut out to be an intrepinure:
I don't want to blow smoke up you hat, or misslead you to beliving that everyone is cut out to be in intrepinure. Some people are just trying to make a quick buck. I wouldn't recomend even hiring those people much less give them atonomy to operate on behalf of your orginization.

###Not all employees need to be intrepinures:
Your best employees are mostl likely increadibly talented, able to hit deadlines, and dedicated as all hell. I am not downing on great employees.

I am trying to help you identify the traits you should be looking for to find those in your orginization that make great intrepinures and show you how they fit into the innovation process.

##What to look for:
###Passionate:
Passion is the number one thing I look for when hiring especially at an early stage. Like they say "Talent is overrated"~Geoffrey Colvin. I have seen passionate people perform miricals because they were so thrilled just to be there working on something they loved doing even though the pay wasn't much.

When I start talking about the technologies we use and I see their eyes light up like a kid in a candy store then I know I have the right developer. When I start walking a canidate through our growth stratigy and before they are hiried they start throuwing out ideas I know I have the right marketing person.

If you throw out an idea and they run with it then you know you have the right people. These people are important because they don't know what they can't do. The funny thing is not knowing those limitations they often times do what others think is impossible.

####Negitive Passion vs Positive Passion:
Passion isn't always positive. Typically I try and recruit only positive people it is possilbe to be passionatly negitive. Think of the person that has been on the job for a number of years that hates the way a certain aspect of their job is done. They are always complaining that it could be done better. It might just to tell them now is the time to "Ship or get off the pot". Give them a little time and resources and have them come up with a better way. Those that jump at the oppertunity and deliver are intrepinures. Those that complain and don't... perhaps its time they moved on in their carreer.

##Resourcefullness:
Great intrepinures shouldn't gripe if you give them a tight deadline and 1/3 of the resources they ask for. They should be greatful. That is a big part of entrepreneurialism; making the most out of what little resources you have.

Resourcefulness is the ability to get the job done no matter what problems are thown your way. Their solution might not be perfect but it gets the job done.

##Creativity:
Everyone might be thinking about a particular idea one way. Creativity allows the intrepinure to see things from a multiple points of view. If everyone in the market is swiming tward the blood red waters it is creativity that allows the intrepinure to look for and find the blue ocean.

_Incase you dont get the above reference it was from [Blue Ocean Strategy ](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190) by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne. A great book on the topic of finding and penitrating untapped markets_


###Relighability:
Passion is not everything though, just like talent isn't everything. The ability to hit a deadline is increadibly important. Tring new things is always risky. If the new product/feature didn't succeed it should be because the market not because your intrepinure failed to deliver on time.

####Real world tip:
I often times assign a little homework to my developers. No, not some beurocratic standerdized test. I give them a list of technologies that we use ,ordered by easiest to master too most difficult.  Then I ask them to take the weekend to build anything. Build a website, a mobile app that beeps at me, pretty much any deliverable will do. Bonus points if the can deliver it to me via github. This helps me see who has the follow through to deliver.

This also helps me gauge their creativity and resourcefullness. You would be amazed how many people when not given step by step paint by the numbers instructions panic and freeze like deer in the headlights. This doesn't mean that they are not great employees, but it does mean that they probablly won't make great intrepinures. You wouldn't want to send them off to invent a new revinue stream for your company.

##Conclustion:
Not everyone is fit to be an intrepinure. It takes passion, resourcefullness, and creativity. Keep your eyes open and look for the those traits in your workforce. Recruting intrepinrures will help you innovate and keep your business on the cutting edge.
