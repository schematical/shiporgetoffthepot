# Building a learning machine

The description in the previous chapter more often then not describes a young go getter. They _don't know what they can't do_ and  _not knowing those limitations they often times do what others think is impossible_. This is a great thing. The problem is that they also don't know a whole lot of other things that they will need to know in order to invent what they need to invent.

I have seen situations where companies recruited a bunch of these young go getters and tried sticking them in a room with a foosball table, an X-Box, and enough redbull to dround a man and hoped they would produce gold. This is a similar approch to putting one thousand monkys at one thousand typewritters and hoping they will eventually produce shakespere. [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)

There is also has a good chance it will turn into a frat party.

##The Apprentistship:
The apprentistship model has evolved over thousands of years only recently put to the side for the university assembly line approch. One might atribute this to education inflation and the demand put on universities to grow. This demand causes universities to put their students in over populated classes with no one on one attention; Spending longer and longer learning completely theoretical information with little focus on realworld expirence.

This is not good for you. You end up hiring individuals with 6+ years of college education that have never actually seen the front line or set foot on the factory floor.

Not to mention the majority of these employees are more worried about paying back their massive student debt then passionatly finding ways to make your business more successful.

###100 Years ago:
Lets take a step back to the days of old. At an early age, some as young as 12, would chose a craft(remember people were not living as long). They would then train for the next 7+ years closly under the supervision of an expirenced craftsmen. Craftsmen were only allowed to take on one or two aprentists at most. During this time the apprentist would not only learn on the job real life skills they would also help make the craftsmen more effecent in their duties by performing a lot of the smaller more tedius tasks that slow down the craftsmen. Though these tasks may seem small and tedius repeting these tasks thousands of times helps further the aprentists knowladge of the trade.

Craftsmen do ntot ask permission to  do a task but could potentially lose their ranking if they do something cray
