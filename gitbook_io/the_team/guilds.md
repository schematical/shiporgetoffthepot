# Guilds
Another form of institution that has evolved over the centuries is the Guild. A group of craftsmen specializing is a specific skill set get together to compare notes, share ideas and further their own abilities. Their focus is extremely niche.

Typically there is an elder or group of elders that have risen to the top of their craft that the other craftsmen, both senior and junior, look up to. When a junior level or apprentice technician needs help they can look to the senior level technician, but when the senior level technician needs assistance then they can go to the elders. The high level technicians are not required to consult with the elder to make their decisions. They still free to make their own decisions so they can run their own shop.

If for some reason a particular high level technician fails to produce quality services or is proving incompetent the elder can suspend their membership or otherwise intervene. This ensures the guilds and the kingdoms reputation to the public.

##How does this actually apply to the real world:
You probably thought I was going to go all Game of Thrones but I do have a point.

Each discipline inside of your organization is like its own guild. Graphic designers, Developers, Server Admins, Project Managers, etc.  Individuals would still spend the vast majority working tightly with their objective focused cross disciplined teams but 1/2 a day every month would be reserved for everyone to gather by discipline.

During this discipline wide meeting they would catch each other up on the following:

* Developments in their projects.
* Emerging Technologies, Techniques
* Learning opportunities
* Team needs(We are looking for a junior developer to move up to another group).



###Directors:
Each discipline would have an 'Elder' or in real world terms the 'director' of a discipline. Director of Technology, Design lead, Chief Marketing Officer; whatever your title format of choice is. As you grow this might be a group of people that forms a committee but don't rush to that. Committee thinking is a dangerous thing. The director/elder's responsibilities would be as follows:

####Set standards and best practices:
One of the risks of having small groups with the authority to make their own decisions is that they might make each make different decisions.

What if each team decided to use different programming languages? Managing such divergent codebase would be near impossible.

What if each team decided to use a different basic color scheme? The users of your products would be confused every time they visit a different section of your product sweet.

The directors would set some standards and best practices. It is important for them to make clear which rules are 'laws' to be followed or else... and which rules are more like guidelines. I would recommend making more guidelines and less laws whenever possible. Boundaries stifle creativity and your teams ability to innovate.


####Provide Learning Experiences:
One of the primary functions of the directors is to share their own experiences and create ways for everyone in their discipline to gain more knowledge and experience. Scheduling speakers, hackathons, and other events that facilitate learning will be a big part of this person's job.

#####Learning from the bottom up:
Ideally your directors would have the foresight to take a lesson from the young passionate people in the organization. If they hear of a junior level technician working with a new technology they would hopefully evaluate it. If the technology could be of value they might have that junior level developer present it to the group so the group could benefit from that knowledge.

This also has the side value of making the above mentioned junior level developer feel valued and their fore happier in their job.

####Recommendations:
A big responsibility of a director will be making recommendations to the king.

A director might help verify the feasibility of proposals for different innovations. They might point out oversights where a proposal missed an important required resource.

The director would be responsible for helping to fill roles on a team. For example a team with graphic design needs would go to the design director who would make a recommendation based off of their available talent.

A junior level developer that has shared a side project might be considered above a higher level technician that has missed a number of educational opportunities. It would be up to the director to use their best judgement.

####Not work on projects:
Depending on the size of your organization your Directors would most likely spend so much time managing their guild that you might want to try and phase them out of the day to day grind.

##Real world tip: Fire Drill
One of the downsides of having small teams is a lack of redundancy. What happens if someone "Gets hit by a bus"? This can mean a couple of things: leaves for another job; gets mad and quits; or literally death or dismemberment. It will happen at some point. How can you minimize the risks involved in not having this type of redundancy?

Those above mentioned standards and education opportunities will help you combat this by ensuring your technicians all are on the same page generally speaking. This only protects you so much. If you want to be ready for potentially devastating change then you must drill for it.

###Real World Tip 1: Fire Drills:
I recommend instead of just waiting around to see what devastation unfolds when a team member abruptly is taken out of the equation is to drill for it. Run what I call fire drills. Without warning walk through your work space one Monday and start grabbing one or two people at random from each team. These people have been 'hit by a bus' and will not be available for the rest of the week.

Your team's will need to come together to make up for the lost resources. They will have to share what is left of their workforce. This forces them to come up with creative ways to work around the problems you have put in front of them. Remember it is not the strongest, the fastest or the smartest that survive; it is those most adaptable to change.

Not all teams will be able to keep up and that is okay. You will at least know how bad it will be when a team member drops and they will be forced to think about preparing for the worst.Sometimes developers code themselves into a position where they are the only one that has a working understanding of a particular piece of your tech. I am sure this happens in other disciplines as well. This might be by accident though often it is not. This creates job security for the developer because they are irreplaceable, but it creates a huge threat to your organization should the developer _get hit by a bus_.


I recommend offering a little bonus to any team able to complete their allotted work with this interruption. Additionally you can take the resources that are _hit by a bus_ and put them to work on another initiative; brainstorming the next big thing.

####Real World Tip 2: Living Operations Manual:
It is fairly standard for large organizations to have a detailed operations manual. Keeping this manual up to date is incredibly difficult while your teams are busy innovating. I suggest using a Wiki instead of a static document. A wiki is a simple piece of software where your team can document their processes. Similar to Wikipedia by allowing everyone to add to your knowledge base has some amazing benefits.

When a junior level team member messes up their punishment is to document how to avoid that mistake so that future team members can learn from it. This forces the team member that made the mistake to evaluate what they did, learn from it, and now if they do it again there is no pretending like they didn't know better.

Everyone would be responsible for adding their part of it. This effectively gives everyone ownership of a peace of your organization. This is important because this feeling of ownership adds to increased job satisfaction.

Though everyone adds obviously the directors and project owners have final say. They can edit, add to or remove anything on the wiki. The software tracks who makes each change so you can always roll back.

Information no longer has to come from the top down. Without this system problems come bubbling up through your hierarchy to you and your directors leaving your employees then waiting for a solution to be passed down from the top. If you utilize this technique your people on the frontline are still making mistakes but they are learning from them and fixing them much faster and without being dependant on you for every little thing.


##Conclusion:
The guild model that has evolved since the castles of old can help your teams grow and thrive even in these modern times. On a day to day basis your craftsmen will work primarily with their focused cross functional teams. But they will need to periodically touch base with the others in their discipline to get on the same page. Finding balance will allow your workforce to be both quick to execute and resistant to catastrophe.
