# Guilds

###Guilds:
How do you ensure the senior level technicians are teaching their aprintists what you want them to teach? You can't and shouldn't.
At the end of most chapters I will tell you how to keep a little control and structure after giving up so much earlier in the chaptor.

Another form of institution that has evolved over the centuries is the Guild. A group of craftsmen get together to compair notes, share ideas and further their own abilities. Their focus is extreamly niche.

Typically there is an elder or group of elders that have risen to the top of their craft that the other craftsmen, both senior and junior, look up to. When a junior level or aprentist technician needs help they can look to the senior level technician, but when the senior level technician needs assistance then they can go to the elders. The high level technicians are not required to consult with the elder to make their decisions. They still free to make thier own decisions so they can run their own shop.

If for some reason a particular high level technican fails to produce quality services or is proving incompetitant the elder can suspend their membership or otherwise intervine. This ensures the guilds reputation to the public.



Imagine for a moment if nothing in the kingdom happened with out the king's say so. In order for something to get built the king himself would dictate the exact specifications to his scribe that would take down in cairful detail and jot it down on his peace of parchment. That parchment would then be delivered to the guild of blacksmiths to be carried out to the word. Keep in mind that neither the king nor his scribe have put in the tens of thousands of hours to become master blacksmiths.

Now lets imagine another kingdom things where the Craftsmen are free to work on what they like. Yes, if the king calls you to his service you drop everything and answer the call but on a day to day basis they are allowed to operate attonimously.

An indeidual member of the Blacksmith' Guild might end up partnering with artisans guild and to build statue or perhaps they might partner with the actors guild to help build cosumes for a play.

Which kingdom would you rather serve in? Or lead for that matter? The first kingdom never has to worry about blacksmiths going out and building something that would hurt the kingdoms reputation but there would be no cultural, technological, or financial innovations.

In the second kingdom where the craftsmen are offerd atonomy and encourage to partner wtih craftsmen from other diciplines
This type of atonomy allows for the amazing cultural, technical advances we have seen in civilazations throughout history.

//TODO: Make that make sense
####How does this actually apply to the real world:
You probablly though I was going to go all Game of Throwns but I do have a point. It is not uncommon in modern orginizations of a certain size to see instructions handed down from the top in an older waterfall fashion.

Each dicipline inside of your orginization is like its own guild.

##Elders/Directors:

##Senior Level Technicians

##Junior Level Technicians(Aprentists)

Craftsmen do ntot ask permission to  do a task but could potentially lose their ranking if they do something cray
