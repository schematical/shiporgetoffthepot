#Comanders Intent:
In the military the chances of the men in the trenches having their communication cut off while in the field is pretty high. Because of that they had to adapt and give up some control. Large standing forces do this with what is called 'Commanders Intent'. The lieutenant says "Take that hill by approaching it from the south and flanking it along the hill to the east". Now what happens if the hill to the east is being bombarded by artillery and communications are cut off, would you still want your men mindlessly marching up the hill to certain death like lemmings? No this is why militaries throughout history have utilized **Commanders Intent**. The lieutenant may have looked at all available information at the time and decided the best strategy was the one outlined above but in case this strategy is no longer feasible then understand that the intent of the order was to "take the hill via any means possible". This allows the troops on the ground a little autonomy.

The Mafia has had to develop similar techniques due to the fact communication is often cut off by the authorities.  Their fore the Don's have to surrender some control by allowing their lieutenants to make their own decisions with the Commander's Intent being **"Make me a lot of money without getting me arrested or whacked"**

The businesses I refer to as the Microsofts often have the same hierarchies but since no one is trying to blow them up or throw them in jail they typically they have not had to adapt the same survival traits mentioned above. They never give up control.

//TODO: Come back to Military example as an extreme with Guerrilla Warfare and that is how far google took it.




###What you get if you don't give up a little control:
In the end you get a work force of uncreative individuals that are afraid to go above and beyond and step outside of the processes you set forth. That if ordered to take the hill via going through the ravine and the ravine was being bombarded would march right in to the enemy fire then figure out a smarter way to take the hill.

You end up with the most senior level people the only ones with the authority to make decisions. Worse yet they are making decisions on information that first has to make the timely journey through your hierarchical game of adult telephone causing important information to arrive inaccurate and too late to act on.





##The New Companies:
This books is about how modern companies are changing how they are structured, how they treat their team members(a term I would much rather use than employees), their customers, and the way they charge for goods and services.
