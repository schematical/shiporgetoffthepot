#Commander's Intent:
In the military the chances of the men in the trenches having their communication cut off while in the field is pretty high. Because of that they had to adapt and give up some control. Large standing forces do this with what is called 'Commanders Intent'. The lieutenant says "Take that hill by approaching it from the south and flanking it along the hill to the east". The sergeant and his platoon go marching off. What happens if when the platoon arrives at the hill to the east it is being bombarded by artillery, would you still want your men mindlessly marching up the hill to certain death like lemmings? No this is why militaries throughout history have utilized **Commanders Intent**.

When strategizing the lieutenant may have looked at all available information at the time and decided the best strategy was the one outlined above, but in case this strategy is no longer feasible the intent of the order is to "take the hill via any means possible". This allows the troops on the ground a little autonomy.

The Mafia has had to develop similar techniques because communication is often cut off by the authorities.  The Don's have to surrender some control by allowing their lieutenants to make their own decisions with the Commander's Intent being **"Make me a lot of money without getting me arrested or whacked"**

###Business have not evolved the same way:
Large businesses often have similar hierarchies but since no one is trying to blow them up or throw them in jail they have not had to adapt the same survival traits mentioned above. They never give up control.

###What you get if you don't give up a little control:
In the end you get a work force of uncreative individuals that are afraid to go above and beyond or step outside of the processes you set forth. That if ordered to take the hill via going through the ravine and the ravine was being bombarded would march right in to the enemy fire rather than figuring out a smarter way to take the hill.

You end up with the most senior level people being the only ones with the authority to make decisions. Worse yet they are making decisions on information that first has to make the timely journey through your hierarchical game of adult telephone causing important information to arrive inaccurate and too late to act on.
