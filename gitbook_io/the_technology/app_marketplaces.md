# App Marketplaces
In the previous chapter I talked about creating a list of your LAB services that people can browse. If you are going to do it for your services you might as well do it for the 3rd party innovations built off your platform as well.

Often times this is called an "App Marketplace". This gives those that build off your functionality a place to showcase and drive traffic to their service. This gives allows them to get the feedback they need to make it better as well as eventually monitize their innovation, encouraging them to build more and add more value to your platform.

App marketplaces typically consist of 3 main screens.

* A list of available apps/services built out on your platform.
* An app/service detail screen that has more specific details on it and a link to use it.
* An edit page so that the app/service owner can register their innovation on your platform and update its information.
