###2.?. Apple - If you refuse to give up atonomy then you better have focus
I felt I needed to throw in an outlier case. Steve Jobs was nutorius for being... a bit of a control freak. He would tinker in every aspect of product design, development, and marketing. So if he didng give up control and give his team members the atonomy I have been going on about then how did Apple become such a sucess.

Perhaps you have heard the story of when Steve returned to Apple in the 90s and drew four boxes on a white board and said "We are going to make four things" two laptops and two desktops, no more printers, nothing else. That is focus. Eventually years later they developed the iPod, then the iPhone but they didn't try to do them all at once, they did it in serial not parrallel allowing their leader Steve to stay focused on one thing at a time.

So if you want to be like Steve and have the finnal say on every little detail and give up little to no attonomy my suggestion is to get focused!

###2.1. Google - Focus on your core
Google has been around for X years and when you go to Google.com the main focus of the page is one thing: that search box(and a funny logo). Google has built countless other services but they still have an increadible focus on thire core value.

####Search Engine:
Though the search box is still google.com's core focus their core value is actual providing marketing oppertunities based off of data.

####GMail:
If they are so focused then why did they make GMail? Having thousands of anonomous people searching for random things on your platform was great but when they wanted to hone in on specific habbits for specific demographics then they needed to know who you are. Making users sign up for a search engine would have dropped them out of the search engine battle. Luckily through google's famouse 20% time they came up with a reason for their users to log in GMail.

Google Analytics, Chrome Browser, and the Android OS are just other amaizing ways they have creativly found ways to measure users habbits and better deliver content both featured and in general to their users. All of this information and distribution network increases their core value of providing marketing oppertunities based off of data.
