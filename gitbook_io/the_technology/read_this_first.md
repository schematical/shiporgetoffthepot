# Read this first
The upcoming sections talk about how to build an innovation platform. This might not always be the right plan of action.

Before you go through the next chaptors which are on the topic of building technology that your people internally and other people externally can build off of and innovate you should first make sure you have a valid business model.

Basically what I am saying is if you havent read [Eric Rise's The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) then you should read that and understand why it is important to validate your ideas.

Some times its smarter to set up a [Launch Rock](http://launchrock.com) page. Other times it might be appropriate to launch a lite version of your app with barebone functionality. Skip the bells and whistles then see what your return on investment is like.

Don't think just because you have been in business for years successfully selling a non-tech product that your imune from the laws of validation do not apply to you. Even the big guys use trap doors, email signup lists and pre sales to test their new ideas. Idea validation is another topic I could spend days talking about but will save that for another day.

In the mean time another great book on the topic of market testing business is [The Four Hour Work Week](http://fourhourblog.com). Tim covers down and dirty real life ways to test business ideas on a shoe string budget.

Please do not fall into the trap of building out the product then seeing if people will pay for it. If you already have your first paying customers and are past the initial chasem then please read on.
