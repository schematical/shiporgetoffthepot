The upcoming sections talk about how to build an "innovation platform". I mean building technology that your people internally and other people externally can build off of and innovate.

This might not always be the right plan of action. Before you go through the next chapters on the topic of you should first make sure you have a valid business model. This may seem obvious to some of you but you would be amazed at how often this step is overlooked.

If you haven't read [Eric Rise's The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) then I strongly recomed you read that before building... anything. It is importent to understand why and how to validate your ideas.

Some times it is smarter to set up a [Launch Rock](http://launchrock.com) page and verify peoples interest in your product before building out your product in full. Other times it might be appropriate to launch a lite version of your app with barebone functionality. Skip the bells and whistles then see what your return on investment is like.

Don't think just because you have been in business for years successfully selling a non-tech product that the laws of validation do not apply to you. Even the big guys use trap doors, email signup lists and pre sales to test their new ideas. Idea validation is another topic I could spend days talking about but will save that for another book.

Another great book on the topic of market testing business is [The Four Hour Work Week](http://fourhourblog.com). Tim covers down and dirty real life ways to test business ideas on a shoe string budget.

##If you build it they will NOT just come:
Please do not fall into the trap of building out the product then seeing if people will pay for it. If you already have your first paying customers and are past the initial chasem then please read on.
