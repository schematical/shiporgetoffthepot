When the world was charging by the Megabyte for storage Youtube decided to go a different route. Seeing [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) in action and realizing that available memory was becomeing more abundant, not scarce, they designed a business model that gave away their storage space for free. By allowing users to release their videos for free they created a network that became the standard for video sharing. Once they had this they could control which content was featured and promoted and this they could control. They created their own demand by drawing in users by giving away something for free that no one else was.

//People feel better when they control the hours they work


Talk about how github did the oposite and started to charge for a service that was formally free:

_Taking a free software and charing for it.
Opensource usages,
If all your opensource libraries are on this service you are somewhat vested in it.
It only make sence when you want to do some work you don't want public you will opt in for a small fee to use their private services.

//Not to devalue the upsell -  I coach at a gymnatics camp that rocks the upsell but upsell is variable, subscription based reviune is like a warm blanket


//Focus on the vast array of services in addition to the base package and that they break down into small distributed teams to relase these services
