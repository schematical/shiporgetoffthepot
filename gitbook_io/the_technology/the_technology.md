#The Technology:
The most niche, but its a big niche. In this section I will cover from a technical standpoints some very specific tatics and technology that will allow your workforce, your partners and your users to build off of your technology creating innovative

##This section is not for everyone:
Bakers, Gymnastics Gym owners and summer camps directors will most likly not find this information useful so feel free to skip to the final chapter.

If you actually like my writing and feel like you got shafted because this chaptor is irrellevant then send me an email and I will try and send you some specialized content that actually does apply to you.

##Who this is for:
Hackers, intrepinures, anyone looking to build a tech product that takes on a life of its own.


##Will be outdated the quickest:
Be aware this information is the most technical in this book and their fore will be outated the quickest. The first section on human nature will stand the test of time while in a couple of years you all be laughing about the technology I said was 'the way of the future'. _You will also probablly be laughing at my choice of clothes and hair style but that is a different problem all together._

##Will be the most highly criticized:
Being as this is developer focused and developers typically have very black and white opinions I expect this will be the most criticized section of the book.
