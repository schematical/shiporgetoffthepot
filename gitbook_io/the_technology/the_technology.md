#The Technology:
We have covered a lot about highly theoretical information. Here I will tell you how to apply these lessionsin a pratical setting.
//TODO: Writer a better intro

##This section is not for everyone:
Bakers, gymnastics gym owners, and summercamp directors will most likly not find this information useful so feel free to skip to the final chapter.

If you actually like my writing and feel like you got shafted because this chaptor is irrellevant then send me an email and I will try and send you some specialized content that actually does apply to you.

##Who this section is for:
Hackers, intrepinures, anyone looking to build a tech product that takes on a life of its own. This is for anyone trying to build an innovation platform.

##This section will be outdated the quickest:
Be aware this information is the most technical in this book and their fore will be outated the quickest. The first section on human nature should stand the test of time while in a couple of years you all be laughing about the technology I said was 'the way of the future'. _You will also probablly be laughing at my choice of clothes and hair style but that is a different problem all together._

##This section will be the most criticized:
Being as this section is developer focused and developers typically have very polerized opinions I expect this will be the most criticized section of the book.

//TODO: Conclusion?
