# Focus vs Diversify
You maybe asking "When should I spin off another focused cross discipline team?". In the technology section that addresses how to apply these high level strategies to a tech product I will discuss in a lot more detail how you might want to split up your workforce. For now let me talk to you about two startups that did the exact opposite and why.


##Focus:
Perhaps you have heard the story of when Steve returned to Apple in the 90s. Apple was in trouble, they had a wide variety of products  and none of them were selling. Steve had focus. He drew four boxes on a white board and said "We are going to make four things" two laptops and two desktops, no more printers, nothing else. That is focus. Eventually years later they developed the iPod, then the iPhone but they didn't try to do them all at once, they did it in serial and parallel allowing their leader and the company as a hole to stay focused on one thing at a time.
//TODO: Illustrate this as a doodle.

So if you want to be like Steve and have the final say on every little detail and give up little to no autonomy my suggestion is to get focused and execute in parallel.

This also works well if you have extremely limited resources. The fewer resources you have the less directions you should be attacking at once. It distracts your team and waters down what you are able to accomplish.

## Diversify:
Google has been around for X years and when you go to Google.com the main focus of the page is one thing: that search box(and a funny logo). Google has built countless other services but they still have an incredible focus on their core value.

####Search Engine:
Though the search box is still google.com's core focus their core value is actual providing marketing opportunities based off of data.

####GMail:
If they are so focused then why did they make GMail? Having thousands of anonymous people searching for random things on your platform was great but when they wanted to hone in on specific habits for specific demographics then they needed to know who you are. Making users sign up for a search engine would have dropped them out of the search engine battle. Luckily through google's famous 20% time they came up with a reason for their users to log in GMail.

Google Analytics, Chrome Browser, and the Android OS are just another amazing ways they have creatively found ways to measure users habits and better deliver content both featured and in general to their users. All of this information and distribution network increases their core value of providing marketing opportunities based off of data.

##Conclusion:
Both this is kind of a trick question. Both companies show and amazing amount of focus. Though Apple did it one product at a time and Google is able to operate in parallel they both were able to keep their teams focused on adding to their core value.
