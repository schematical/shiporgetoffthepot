# Lab/20% Time


##Build A Lab:
A 'lab' is a safe enviroment to showcase your innovations and let early adaptors test them. This also helps draw a thick line between the early adaptors and those on the other side of the Chasim that are more risk adverse.

I used to use PayPal Labs as my example but it looks like they shut that down.



###Lab or Beta Services:
The exception to this is when an service is still in a rough experimenatal place. Say a developer creates a service using their 20% time and launches it(all with out even asking permission). They could register it with your core list of applications but they would NOT have the ability to make it a SUPER level application. So when user go to use it it would appear that it is a 3rd party application that is use at your own risk.

I would take it a step further and give that same passioniote developer the ability to list the project as LAB instead of SUPER. Lab would still require the user to go through the OAuth process to gain access to the service but also have documentation explaining that the service is in a raw state and that they are taking place in an early adaptor program.

It would also instantly list the project on a list of similar innovative 20% expirements that our early adaptor users could come to and browse the next big thing. This would instantly give

Since the developer can do all of this without asking permission I would probablly make this process of registering a "Lab" application send out an email to all exects and decision makers.
