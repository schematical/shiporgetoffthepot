#20% Time/The Lab:
By now you have to have heard of Google's 20% time. If your reading this book you probablly have pondered the following questions:


*How do I create a simple process for my team to launch their innovations and get feedback.*

*How do I ensure that my core product's image is not tarnished by users not understanding which features are new raw and potentially buggy innovations.*

*How do I ensure that raw innovations do not affect my core product in any way?*

My answers to all the above problems is to build a lab.

##Build A Lab:
A 'lab' is a safe enviroment to showcase your innovations and let early adaptors test them. This also helps draw a thick line between the early adaptors and those on the other side of the Chasim that are more risk adverse.

Say a developer creates a service using their 20% time and launches it(all with out even asking permission). They could register it with your core list of applications but they would NOT have the ability to make it a SUPER level application. So when user go to use it it would appear that it is a 3rd party application that is use at your own risk.

I would take it a step further and give that same passioniote developer the ability to list the project as LAB instead of SUPER. Lab would still require the user to go through the OAuth process to gain access to the service but also have documentation explaining that the service is in a raw state and that they are taking place in an early adaptor program.

It would also instantly list the project on a list of similar innovative 20% expirements that our early adaptor users could come to and browse the next big thing. This would instantly drive early adaptors to the new innovative 20% service.

ou could chose weather or not to make this listing of lab services public or reserve it for hand selected invite only early adaptors. I personally would open it up to the public.

Since the developer can do all of this without asking permission I would probablly make this process of registering a "Lab" application send out an email to all exects and decision makers. This creates a system that enforces the _'ask forgiveness, not permission'_ mentality that fosters innovation.

Since in the last chapter we talked about how you can run your services on multiple servers obviously these lab services would be run seperate from the core servers or any other production services. I keep a single server instance up that my junior devs can launch their innovations on and play around with.

###Taking it to the next level:
When and how do you take it to the next level of officially becoming part of your product? I would start by looking at the numbers. How many users OAuthed with your product? Also look at how many records were created. For example if it was an Event booking feature how many  events were booked? How many people RSVPed for the events?

Finally since you know who authed reach out to these people either by email or directly and ask them what they thought. Their feedback is vital.

Once you have all of this information you can look at the resources you have available and decide if the product will add enough value for your users that it is worth building. There are obviously more stratigic critical thinking involved here but I will save market stratigy for another book.

At this point either tell the person who invented the innovation to either keep improving it until it adds the value your users are asking for or create a repo, put together a team and let them have at it.

##Conclusion:
By clearly defining a Lab you can encourage your team to innovate by giving them a process to test their ideas in a way that is safe to your core product and brand.
