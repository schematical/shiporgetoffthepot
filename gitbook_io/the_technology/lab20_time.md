#20% Time/The Lab:
I assume you have to have heard of Google's 20% time. If you are reading this book you probably have pondered the following questions:

*How do I create a simple process for my team to launch their innovations and get feedback.*

*How do I ensure that raw innovations do not hinder my core product in any way?*

*How do I ensure that my core product's image is not tarnished by users not understanding which features are new, raw and potentially buggy innovations.*

My answers to all the above problems is to build a lab.

##Build A Lab:
A 'lab' is a safe environment to showcase your innovations and let early adopters test them. This also helps draw a thick line between the early adopters and those on the other side of the Chasm that are more risk averse.

Say a developer creates a service using their 20% time and launches it(all without even asking permission). They could register it with your core list of applications but they would NOT have the ability to make it a SUPER level service as discussed in the section on SSO. So when user go to use it the service would appear that it is a 3rd party application that is use at your own risk.

I would take it a step further and give that same passionate developer the ability to list the project as LAB instead of SUPER. Lab would still require the user to go through the OAuth process to gain access to the service but also have documentation explaining that the service is in a raw state and that they are taking place in an early adopter program.

Listing a service as LAB also lists the project with similar innovative 20% time experiments. Our early adopter users could come and browse this list so they could find new experimental services to play with and give feedback on.

You could choose whether or not to make this listing of lab services public or reserve it for hand selected invite only early adopters. I personally would open it up to the public to crowd source as much feedback as possible.

Since the developer can do all of this without asking permission I would probably make this process of registering a "Lab" application send out an email to all executives and decision makers. This creates a system that enforces the _'ask forgiveness, not permission'_ mentality that fosters innovation.

Obviously these lab services would be run separate from any other production services. I keep a single server instance up that my junior devs can launch their innovations on and play around with.

###Taking it to the next level:
When and how do you take it to the next level of officially becoming part of your product? I would start by looking at the numbers. How many users OAuthed with your product? Also look at how many records were created. For example if it was an Event booking feature how many  events were booked? How many people RSVPed for the events?

Finally since you know who authed reach out to these people either by email or directly and ask them what they thought. Their feedback is vital.

Once you have all of this information you can look at the resources you have available and decide if the product will add enough value for your users that it is worth building out further. There are obviously more strategic critical thinking involved here but I will save market strategy for another book.

At this point either tell the person who invented the innovation to keep improving the service until it adds the value your users are asking for or pull the trigger on it by creating a new repo, put together a team and letting them have at it.

##Conclusion:
Clearly defining a Lab you can encourage your team to innovate by giving them a process to test their ideas in a way that is safe to your core product and brand. Once this process is in place you will see some amazing things come through.
