###2.2. Innovation can come from externally as well as internally
Facebook didn't just hord all of your social information for its own uses or to charge to get access to your info. No they opened up their API's (Application Programming Interface wich allows developers to talk to their platform progrmaitcally). This allowed information to flow freely out of and into Facebook, with the users premission of course.

The old way of thinking would have kept this locked down but by opening it up for free they created much more value for their users and their fore increased their value as a network.

//NOTE: Perhaps focus on network value and data value here
//Note2: Worlds biggest crystal ball

Furthermore this allowed them to crowdsource innovation. If they saw an app they liked they could aquire them and know that the technology was already compatible with their own technology.
