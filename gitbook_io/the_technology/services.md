I have spent countless hours talking about how splitting up your workforce into small cross functional dedicated teams will help your business survive and innovate. Now I am going to talk about how to do the same thing with your technology so you can build your own innovation platform.

##A quick history lesson:
Lets go back to the year 1998 when software like Quicken, Vizo, or Windows were released on a yearly schedule. Lets say you had a team of 1000 developers and designers(though it could be argued that no one back then put any thought into design) all working furiously to pump out next years software release.
Even if you split them into functional teams, which often times was not the case, what are the chances they would all be done at the same time? Almost impossible. So you have 50% of your workforce scrambling to cramb in their undertested featureset and 50% sitting on their butts. Maybe you plan better and make sure the former 50% didn't bit off more then they can chew and so they are finished so then you have 100% sitting on their butts.

If they are resting on their lorals why not put them to work on next years software? That is great(sarcasim), lets start building software that will sit on the shelve with zero user feedback for the next 12+ months?

That massive delay in feedback combined with the completely ineffecent way of managing resources made these companies fall behind the curve.

##And then came SaaS:
Software as a Service(SaaS) or 'Cloud Services' paved the way for a the way new model. In SaaS you, the business, host the software on your servers. Users go to your website, signup, and interact with e software still running on your servers through their browser. No instilation, no saving info to the users computer.

Since the software is running on your servers you can change it anytime you like. There is no need to wait until a certain release date. This allows you to release in smaller iterations. You could release one new change a month instead of a bunch of big changes. You then could monitor user feedback each month to help guide your product design and prioritize new features. Since these releases are monthly you can make key decisions much faster which makes you more adaptable to market change and increases your chance of success.

This is one of the reasons why startups working building a SaaS product were out pacing the tech giants releasing on a yearly schedule. Because they could see market change and get user feedback at such a rapid pace. This made it easy to out run the giants.

##Moving to fast can be dangerious too:
Every successfuly startup has to grow and inevitably they will add more on to their software. What happens when you move to fast and start growing bigger then communication becomes tougher. Software that depends on each other will break if changes are introduced and not properly communicatied. Obviuolsy this causes bugs.

Keepiung your small focused groups can fix some of this. Team A's sole purpose is the managing the event planning portion of the app. Team B's sole purpose is managing the messaging system. This helps alot but it is still not perfect.

What if team A's peace of software is dependant on team B's peace of the software and team B's peace of software isn't quite ready to get released yet?

<--------//Finish above thought then -What about innovation, 20% time, Lab, etc -- I have a system for that



##PaaS:
There is another model called Platform as a Service(PaaS). This is where you offer an interface for other developers to build their own SaaS's off of your systems.

If you are thinking about building a Platform before you have users paying for your existing SaaS products then you will want to jump back to Chapter 3.1(//TODO: This might change) and read more about validation.

##Identifying Services:
Running on many servers/removes risk from the core

PS: I sometimes refer to services as as applications.

###Feature Services:

##Tie it all together with the core:
//Core's main responsibility

//Who

//What?
