<p>The description in the previous chapter more often than not describes a young go getter. They <em>don&#39;t know what they can&#39;t do</em> and  <em>not knowing those limitations they often times do what others think is impossible</em>. These are great things. The problem is that they also don&#39;t know a whole lot of other things that they will need to know in order to invent what they need to invent.</p>
<p>I have seen companies recruit a bunch of these young go getters and tried sticking them in a room with a foosball table, an X-Box, and enough red bull to drown a man in hopes they would produce gold. This is a similar approach to putting one thousand monkeys at one thousand typewriters and hoping they will eventually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem" target="_blank">produce Shakespeare</a>.</p>

Its not that simple.</p>
<h2 id="the-apprenticeship-model">The Apprenticeship Model:</h2>
<p>The apprenticeship model has evolved over thousands of years only recently put to the side for the university assembly line approach. One might attribute this to education inflation and the demand put on universities to grow. This demand causes universities to put their students in over populated classes with no one on one attention; Spending longer and longer learning completely theoretical information with little focus on real world experience.</p>
<p>This is not good for you. You end up hiring individuals with 6+ years of college education that have never actually seen the front line or set foot on the factory floor.</p>
<p>Not to mention the majority of these employees are more worried about paying back their massive student debt then passionately finding ways to make your business more successful.</p>
<h3 id="100-years-ago">100 Years ago:</h3>
<p>//TODO: Illustration of a blacksmith forging armor with an aprintist</p>
<p>Lets take a step back to the days of old. At an early age, some as young as 12, would chose a craft(remember people were not living as long). They would then train for the next 7+ years closely under the supervision of an experienced craftsmen. Craftsmen were only allowed to take on one or two apprentices at at a time. During this time the apprentice would not only learn real life skills on the job they would also help make the craftsmen more efficient in their duties by performing a lot of the smaller more tedious tasks that slow down the craftsmen. Though these tasks may seem small and tedious repeating these tasks thousands of times helps to further the apprentices knowledge of the trade.</p>
<h3 id="my-apprenticeship-as-a-gymnastics-coach">My apprenticeship as a gymnastics coach:</h3>
<p>For those of you that don&#39;t know I also coach high level competitive gymnastics. I never went to college to be a gymnastics coach. When I was 16 I was a lifeguard at the local YMCA and one day I was upstairs goofing around with the gymnasts my age when the head coach, who had just hurt her back, saw me and said &quot;You look like a meat head do you want to learn to spot?&quot; Spotting is the act of catching gymnasts so they land safely while learning their skills. This is how I started coaching. I became the head coaches apprentice doing the heavy lifting and starting with the non technical tasks the head coach&#39;s indepth knowledge was not required to perform safely.</p>
<p>Eventually I began to attend Gymnastics camps in the summer. For the first decade I spent most of my time assigned to coaching the lower levels. But in my free time I was able to follow around and learn from hundreds of high level national team and olympic coaches. After about a decade of coaching like this I found myself coaching champion athletes, collegiate athletes and even spent a hand full of weeks helping the Icelandic National champion with advanced uneven bar skills.</p>
<p>Now in the summer I hold clinics(classes) that teach other coaches how to coach various skills and I have had some apprentices of my own. I still very much consider myself a student of the sport and have several great craftsmen as mentors <em>(a shout out to J Orkowski and Greg Frew who mentor me both as a coach and a businessman)</em>. My point is I would have never gotten anywhere if I hadn&#39;t started as an apprentice doing the most basic of tasks.</p>
<h3 id="lets-bring-back-the-apprentice-model">Lets bring back the apprentice model:</h3>
<p>I have had amazing results applying the apprentice/craftsman model in the world of tech startups. I have taken people with basically zero experience and taught them how to efficiently build amazing products and keep our servers operational. There is a huge upside to applying this model to your organization.</p>
<h4 id="keep-your-senior-level-people-focused">Keep your senior level people focused:</h4>
<p>The apprenticeship model allows your senior level talent to offload some of the lower priority or less technical tasks to the aprintist. This allows the senior level craftsmen to stay focused on the tasks that will add the most value.</p>
<p>The senior developers don&#39;t need to be distracted by pixel pushing and css changes, which do add valuable polish to the final product, but in the grand scale of things are far less important than ensuring the servers are up or that your site is not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks.</p>
<p>A senior level UI Designer might offload the designing of a lessor used settings page so that they can focus on the all important signup process.</p>
<h4 id="its-cost-efficient">Its cost efficient:</h4>
<p>Apprentices get paid primarily in knowledge and experience. As any great craftsmen knows you can&#39;t start out charging a premium until you have a couple of wins under your belt. When I was a sophmore in highschool I offered to sweep the floors of a local tech shop for free in exchange for the chance just to observe what they were doing.</p>
<p>Some might think of this as exploitation. That is only the case if you are NOT providing the apprentice with valuable knowledge and experience. If you force the apprentice to sign an NDA that says they can&#39;t even talk about your project or list it on their portfolio of work then you might be giving them a bum deal.</p>
<p>If you take on apprentices it is your job and the job of the senior technicians that you pair them with to ensure that they are getting the knowledge and experience that they deserve.</p>
<h5 id="real-world-tip">Real world tip:</h5>
<p><em>NOTE: I am not an attorney nor an expert on employment laws. This is just my personal rule that I and many other entrepreneurs follow</em></p>
<p>I typically pay my apprentices something directly related to how much value the add. Even my zero experience interns get some financial compensation; they have to eat and I don&#39;t want them coming in sleep deprived because they are working nights at a factory to pay rent.</p>
<p>One scenario where you do have to pay is anytime intellectual property is created. This means all coders, designers, and copywriters. They will need to sign an intellectual property agreement that states the intellectual property(code, designs, etc) is owned by you.</p>
<h4 id="too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen">Too Many cooks in the kitchen:</h4>
<p>I have been on projects where the solution seemed to be just to hire more senior level technical talent and throw them into a room. This often breaks down into squabbling over whose method is best and who has the biggest ego in the room (Both developers and gymnastics coaches have gigantic egos).</p>
<p>You will get better results with 9 entry level people being lead by one senior level person all moving in the same direction in rhythm then you will with 10 senior level people trying to do things their own way moving in different directions.</p>
<h4 id="personal-interaction">Personal interaction:</h4>
<p>A solid one on one mentor apprentice relationship gets forged. Have you ever had that one teacher that really made a difference in your life? It wasn&#39;t in a crowded lecture hall I bet.</p>
<p>This kind of relationship early on will increase job satisfaction for the apprentices and give the senior level craftsmen the satisfaction of knowing they really make a difference. Both parties are happier and more effective at doing their jobs.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-forces-you-to-take-your-craft-to-the-next-level">Teaching forces you to take your craft to the next level:</h4>
<p>Finally teaching the skills of my craft has always forced me to think and rethink about every aspect of what I do. Having your mid-high level technicians take the time to carefully review their own processes and habits will allow them to weed out inefficiencies and improve their own performances.</p>
<p>To be honest a big part of why I am writing this book is to help me sharpen my own skills and abilities by teaching you. The amount of research and time spent organizing and reflecting on that accumulated knowledge has taken me to a whole new level of my craft.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The aprintist model has been around for a long time and only recently since the education system became a business have we abandoned it for the assembly line method. If your business isn&#39;t selling textbooks then the best way to educate your junior level talent is one on one attention from a senior level craftsmen.</p>
