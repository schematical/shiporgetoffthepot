<p>The description in the previous chapter more often then not describes a young go getter. They <em>don&#39;t know what they can&#39;t do</em> and  <em>not knowing those limitations they often times do what others think is impossible</em>. This is a great thing. The problem is that they also don&#39;t know a whole lot of other things that they will need to know in order to invent what they need to invent.</p>
<p>I have seen situations where companies recruited a bunch of these young go getters and tried sticking them in a room with a foosball table, an X-Box, and enough redbull to dround a man and hoped they would produce gold. This is a similar approch to putting one thousand monkys at one thousand typewritters and hoping they will eventually produce shakespere. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem" target="_blank"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-apprentistship">The Apprentistship:</h2>
<p>The apprentistship model has evolved over thousands of years only recently put to the side for the university assembly line approch. One might atribute this to education inflation and the demand put on universities to grow. This demand causes universities to put their students in over populated classes with no one on one attention; Spending longer and longer learning completely theoretical information with little focus on realworld expirence.</p>
<p>This is not good for you. You end up hiring individuals with 6+ years of college education that have never actually seen the front line or set foot on the factory floor.</p>
<p>Not to mention the majority of these employees are more worried about paying back their massive student debt then passionatly finding ways to make your business more successful.</p>
<h3 id="100-years-ago">100 Years ago:</h3>
<p>Lets take a step back to the days of old. At an early age, some as young as 12, would chose a craft(remember people were not living as long). They would then train for the next 7+ years closly under the supervision of an expirenced craftsmen. Craftsmen were only allowed to take on one or two aprentists at most. During this time the apprentist would not only learn on the job real life skills they would also help make the craftsmen more effecent in their duties by performing a lot of the smaller more tedius tasks that slow down the craftsmen. Though these tasks may seem small and tedius repeting these tasks thousands of times helps further the aprentists knowladge of the trade.</p>
<h3 id="lets-bring-it-back">Lets bring it back:</h3>
<p>I have had amazing reasults applying the aprintist/craftsmen model in the world of tech startups. I have taken people with basically zero experence and tought them how to effecently build our products and keep our servers opperational.</p>
<h3 id="my-apprentistship-as-a-gymnasitcs-coach">My apprentistship as a gymnasitcs coach:</h3>
<p>For those of you that don&#39;t know I also coach high level competitive gymnastics. I never went to college to be a gymnasitcs coach. When I as 16 I was a life guard at the local YMCA and one day I was upstair flirting with the other 16 year old gymnasts(poorly I might add) when the head coach who had just hurt their back saw me and said &quot;You look like a Meat Head&quot; do you want to learn to spot? Spoting is the act of catching gymnasts so they land safely while learning their skills. This is how I started coaching. I became the head coaches apprintist doing the heavy lifiting and starting with the non technical tasks the head coach&#39;s indepth knowladge was not required to perform safely.</p>
<p>Eventually I began to attend Gymnastics camps in the summer. For the first decaide I spent most of my time assigned to coaching the lower levels. But in my free time I was able to follow around and learn from hundreds of high level national team and olympic coaches. After about a decaide of coaching like this I found myself coaching champion atheletes, collegic atheletes and even spent a hand full of weeks helping the Icelandic National champ on bars.</p>
<p>Now in the summer I hold clinics(classes) that teach other coaches how to coach various skills and I have had some apprintists of my own. I still very much consider myself a studient of the sport and have several great craftsmen as mentors<em>(a shout out to J Orkowski and Greg Frew who mentor me both as a coach and as a businessmen)</em>. My point is I would have never gotten anywhere if I hadn&#39;t started as an aprentist doing the most basic of tasks.</p>
<h3 id="benifits-of-the-apprintistship-model">Benifits of the Apprintistship Model:</h3>
<p>There are numourious benifits to the aprentistship model as it applies to your orginization.</p>
<h4 id="to-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen">To Many cooks in the kitchen:</h4>
<p>I have been on projects where the solution seemed to be just to hire more senior level technical talent and throw them into a room. This often breaks down into squabling over whos method is best and how has the biggest ego in the room (Both developers and gymnastics coaches have giagantic egos).</p>
<p>You will get better results with 9 entry level peopl being lead by one senior level person all moving in the same direction in rythem than you will with 10 senior level people trying to do things their own way moving in different driections.</p>

<p>//TODO: IDK WHERE I AM GOING WITH THIS- PROB CUT IT
One of the things I hate about cubicals and that whole structure is that there is a lack of personal connectivity. If you get treated like just another cog in a machine then you start to treat others the sameway. When entry level people get hired without a mentor, just a boss then...</p>
<h4 id="keep-your-senior-level-people-focused">Keep your senior level people focused:</h4>
<p>The apprintistship model allows your sernior level talent to offload some of the lower priority or less technical tasks to the aprintist. This allows them to stay focused on the tasks that will add the most value.</p>
<p>The senior developers don&#39;t need to be distracted by pixel pushing and css changes, which do add valuable polish to the final product, but in the grand scale of things are far less important then ensureing the servers are up or that your site is not vaulnrable to cross site scripting.</p>
<p>A senior level UI Designer might offload the designing of a lessor used settings page so that they can focus on the all important signup process.</p>
<h4 id="its-cost-effecent">Its cost effecent:</h4>
<p>Apprintests get paid primarily in knowladge and expirence. As any great craftsmen knows you can&#39;t start out charging a premium until you have a couple of wins under your belt. When I was a sophmore in highschool I offered to sweep the floors of a local tech shop for free in exachange for the chance just to observe what they were doing.</p>
<p>Some might think of this as exploitation. That is only the case if you are NOT providing the aprentist with valuable knowadge and expirence. If you force the apprenitist to sign an NDA that says they cant even talk about your project or list it on their portfolio of work then you might be giving them a bum deal.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you take on apprentists it is your job and the job of the senior technicians that you pair them with to ensure that they are getting the knowladge and expirence that they deserve.</p>
<h5 id="real-world-tip">Real world tip:</h5>
<p><em>NOTE: I am not an attourney nor an expert on employment laws. This is just my personal rule that I an many other Enripunures follow</em></p>
<p>I typically pay my apprentests something directly related to how much value the add. Even my zero expirence interns get some financial compensation; they have to eat and I don&#39;t want them coming in sleep deprived because they are working nights at a factory to pay rent.</p>
<p>One scenerio where you do have to pay is anytime intelectual property is created. This means all coders, designers, and copywriters. They will need to sign an intelectual property agreement that states the intelectual property(code, designs, etc) is owened by you. More on this later on</p>
<p>//TODO: Make sure you write this(You deleted it from the end so you need to add more detail here)</p>
<h4 id="teching-forces-you-to-take-your-craft-to-the-next-level">Teching forces you to take your craft to the next level:</h4>
<p>Finally teaching the skills of my craft has always froced me to think and rethink about every aspect of what I do. Having your mid-high level technicians take the time to carfully review their own processes and habbits will allow them to weed out inneffecenties and improve their own performances</p>
<p>To be honest 1/2 the reason I am writing this book is to help me sharpen my own skills and abilities. The ammount of research and time spent orginizing and reflecting on that accumliated knowadge has taken me to a whole other level of craftsmen.</p>
