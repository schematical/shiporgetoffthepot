<p>//TODO: Proof read one
Utilizing these systems have numours benifits for you individual team members over the large hiarchial silo based systems. Splitting up your workforce into small cross functional teams that focus exclusivly on one particualr feature that they can take ownership of has the following benifits:</p>
<h2 id="they-can-take-ownership">They can take ownership:</h2>
<p>If you are part of a massive team and are constantly switching focus  there is no one peace you can focus on for too long. Today you design a tiny peace of feature A, tomorrow you have to shift gears to focus a miniscule peace of feature Z. Your never get a chance to dig in and take ownership of any one thing.</p>
<p>When I say ownership I don&#39;t mean equity, or cash. Sculpters would spend their entire adult lifes crafting the statues that would line the walls of a single catherdual. They would have something tangable that they could show to their children and their grand children and say &quot;I did this&quot;. That is what I mean by ownership; being able to wake up and say &quot;The success or failure of this depends on me&quot;. Some employees don&#39;t want that but intrepinures will.</p>
<h2 id="they-wont-feel-like-a-cog-in-a-machine">They wont feel like a cog in a machine.</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1591845327" target="_blank">Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek </a> Simon talks about how work performance suffers when you dont feel in control of your own destiny. You don&#39;t feel safe so you hold back. You don&#39;t know what managment will do tomorrow. Perhaps massive cuts will be made tomorrow so you should hold back your best ideas. This way you can present them later in an attempt to look more valuable then your coworkers.</p>
<p>Feeling like a cog in a machine is demoralizing. Feeling expendable is an awful feeling. If you give your team members the oppertunity to own something then they are no longer a replacable cog but a respcected craftsmen creating works of art. Ideally they will see it that way to and put in the time in effort into each task to create the best possible outcome.</p>
<h2 id="increased-interpersonal-interaction">Increased interpersonal interaction:</h2>
<p>As we evolved our survival depended more and more on our ability to function as a community. We did not untill recently start to spend the majority of our day staring at a glowing box in an isolated room. Being in issolation long enough causes depression and stress that take away from our ability to work.</p>
<p>This is partially why you have crew congragating around the watercooler. They can only hydrate so much. They crave socilization. If they are not at the watercooler they are online browsing picutres of cats posted in some online community.</p>
<p>You might be afraid that putting your teams together around a table instead of in issolation might be bad for productivity. This maybe the case if they don&#39;t all have the formentioned motivaters. If everyone around that table feels ownership and belives in what they are doing it quickly becomes more apitizing to chat about how to improve the product then about distractions.</p>
<p>Yes your technicians will need peace and quiet to hammer things out but that is what headphones were created for. I have to constantly juggle the technician and manager hat and find that it takes a balence of solitued that I can acomplish with headphones. But I wouldn&#39;t give up the feeling I get when I can look up and see the others on my small cross functional team hammering out code next to me.</p>
<h2 id="what-ties-all-the-teams-together">What ties all the teams together?</h2>
<p>There is story you have probablly heard about NASA when we were first trying to send a man to the moon. JFK was touring NASA for an update talking to all of the high profile scientists, pilots and politicians when he came across a janitor cleaning. The janitor was vigoursly cleaning as if his life depended on it. The president stoped him and asked &quot;What are you doing?&quot;. To which the janitor repied &quot;Helping put a man on the moon&quot;.</p>
<p>It is important that every person in your orginization shares your vision and feels like they are a part of it. Again I could go on and on about leadership and the importance of it but I will save that for another book.</p>
<p>What is your cause? Is your company only here to make money? That vision works for thousands of Wall street companies or are you trying to change the world? You might argue that every business is out to make money and to be realistic this is true but is that all they are doing or is money a means to an end? If so what is that end?</p>
<p>You must have a clear vision of where you want to go and you will need to be able to commuicate that. Without that then your teams will each be working tward their own direction.</p>
<p>Luckily for us it is easier to commuicate a vision then it is every detail of every task day to day. Use your vision and not your opperations maunual to set the direction you want your company to be moving in.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Up coming chapters will outline how education can be used as a motivater as well. For now your workforce will appreaciate you treating them as individuals not cogs and empowering them to focus and take ownership. Using the techniques in this book will acomplish that and have your workfroce hammering out amazing products at an increadible rate.</p>
