                        <h1 id="it-takes-a-team">It takes a team:</h1>
<p>It is rare that one person can truly be effective in delivering change across a large scale. Though throughout history there may have been a single person on stage in the spotlight but there is always a solid support team behind them.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-small-teams">Benefits of small teams:</h2>
<p>Please don&#39;t call homeland security on me for this next part but I would like to take a lesson from those that have practiced Guerilla Warfare for years and years. Guerrilla Warfare is not always the most effective way to fight. Marching 1000 men shoulder to shoulder might be the most efficient way to win a battle. That is how wars were thought for thousands of years all the way up to the american revolution. We were outnumbered and outgunned so we split our forces into smaller divisions that hid in the woods.</p>
<p>The revolutionaries were not given step by step orders orders like &#39;march across delaware to the south over this hill and around this ravine then battle the red coats head on&#39;. Instead they were taught strategies and techniques then sent out to execute these order autonomously. Strategies like find and cut off the enemy&#39;s supply train. Techniques such as how to hide in the woods and execute an ambush.</p>
<h3 id="focus">Focus:</h3>
<p>For our above mentioned example the general would have picked a specific battalion of men and told them to hold the western front via any means necessary. He would then send another battalion of men with the intent of taking a city to the east. Each battalion could be much more efficient because their attention was not split between the two activities.</p>
<p>If you have a large organization with many different objectives then it becomes easy to lose focus. Decisions like should I work on Objective A, B, or C today become difficult.</p>
<p>If you are on a team whose sole focus is clearly one objectives then it makes it easy to focus and make decisions. This also save you the mental penalty you pay each time you shift tasks.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication:</h3>
<p>The smaller the team the closer the decision makers on the team are to the front line. Every link you can remove from that hierarchical game of human telephone brings your decisions makers that much closer to being able to make important real time decisions.</p>
<h3 id="reaction-speed">Reaction Speed:</h3>
<p>The smaller the team the fewer people that need to be wrangled for meetings. Fewer people that need to approve decisions that will determine the fate of your project. It the bureaucratic practice of wrangling and waiting for approval that burns the most amount of time and leave your business behind the competition.</p>
<p>Part of the reason startups are flying past you is it is easy to get approval when your just three guys in a dorm. &quot;Should I build this dude?&quot; - &quot;Yeah that would be cool&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="accountability">Accountability:</h3>
<p>The smaller the team the less people there are to point fingers at when the $&amp;*% hits the fan. People will have to take responsibility for their own actions. No more &quot;well if the guys over in accounting had gotten us those numbers...&quot;. Its your team, its your ass.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-team">Anatomy of a team:</h2>
<p>//Variety is important
What is a sniper without a spotter to ensure there are no dangers outside of the snipers scope? Or an air force without an army to protect its planes while they are refueling?</p>
<p>Effective teams are made up of a variety of skillsets, personalities and levels of skill. We will cover why the variety of levels of experience is important in the next chapter. Here I want to talk about the need for a variety of skills and personalities.</p>
<h2 id="personality-types">Personality Types:</h2>
<h3 id="visionaries-vs-executors">Visionaries vs Executors:</h3>
<p>Recently I was able to observe this in action in a small healthcare startup founded by two men. I will just call them the visionary and the executor. People in our community were critical of the visionary accusing him of benefiting off of the work of the executioner. This may have been true but at the same time some employees only took the job because they believed in the visionaries vision. The visionary was also constantly trying to expand and innovate their services while the executioner was trying to stay focused on scaling their existing revenue streams. Which was the right strategy? The truth is probably a little bit of both.</p>
<p>This is a common division in startups. The visionaries Steve Jobs, and the executors, Steve Wozniack. Would Jobs have been able to build the foundation of the apple empire without Waz there to build the products? Would Waz have been able to sell his brilliant hardware designs with out Jobs&#39; charisma and vision? Would Waz have even had the vision to see the possibilities? It is a chicken and the egg scenario.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills:</h2>
<p>Not to get corny but do you remember the A-Team... yeah its kinda like that. Imagine if you had a team of all BA Baracus all running around acting the tough guy or all Faces chasing the girl. I can only imagine what a team of Murdocks would accomplish. The small teams inside of your organization need to have the same cross section of skills.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-tech-team">Anatomy of a tech team:</h3>
<p>Since I mainly deal in tech startups I will use this as my example but I don&#39;t care if you run a bakery, a gymnastics gym, or a summer camp small cross discipline teams are much more adept to react to situations as they come up compared with large silos of people.</p>
<h4 id="designers">Designers:</h4>
<p>There are many types of designers, check <a href="http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/how-to-hire-a-good-start-up-designer/" target="_blank">my post on ShipOrGetOffThePot.com</a> for more detailed write ups on what each one does. You will most likely need a nice cross section of User Experience, User Interface, Product, and Graphic designers to get the job done. Designers take a top down approach to building the product looking at what the customer needs first.</p>
<h4 id="engineers">Engineers:</h4>
<p>Engineers take a bottom up approach to building the product. They look at your resouces and figure out how to make your product work.</p>
<h4 id="marketingsales-people">Marketing/Sales People:</h4>
<p>These people are responsible for getting it out to the masses. They  are also responsible for getting feedback on it. One way shout it out markeing is dead, in reality it never really existed. You always get feedback on your product in the form of paying customers or lack there of. No paying customers equals bad feedback. Both marketers and sales people are responsible for shouting out about your product as well as listening. In reality this is every team member&#39;s responsibility but these guys specialize in it a little more.</p>
<h4 id="project-manager">Project Manager:</h4>
<p>This person makes sure everyone is on the same page. Communication, scheduling and timelines, etc. The project manager is not the &#39;boss&#39;, but more of a resource. This person bridges communication, gathers resources, and orginizes timelines with the feedback of the designers and engineers.</p>
<h4 id="project-owner">Project Owner:</h4>
<p>Were missing one thing though, who is incharge? Remember shit rolls up hill. If something isn&#39;t going to plan or someone isn&#39;t doing their job who is responsible to catch that awful smelling snowball before it reaches you? The project owner.</p>
<p>This could be any of the above designers, engineers, marketing/sales people, or project managers. It is up to you to determine who you can trust with such responsibility. Maybe it is the junior level employee that came to you pitching a new idea for a revinue stream. Maybe it is a veterned employee that you pair with that junior level employee to keep them on track.</p>
<p>Use your best judgment. I could go on and on about leadership but I will save that for another book. For now understand that two things:</p>
<h5 id="the-project-owner-needs-to-be-a-leader">The project owner needs to be a leader:</h5>
<p>This person needs to be more than a boss; They need to be a leader. There is a big difference. Check out my post <a href="http://shiporgetoffthepot.com/are-you-a-boss-or-a-leader/" target="_blank">Are you a Boss or a Leader</a> on <a href="shiporgetoffthepot.com">shiporgetoffthepot.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="they-need-to-be-ready-to-take-responsibilty">They need to be ready to take responsibilty:</h5>
<p>If the project fails weather it is market conditions, bad decisions or act of god, the project owner needs to be able to take responsibility for it. The weight is on their shoulders. They need to honestly be able to communicate the teams failures to you in a timly fashion. Don&#39;t be too hard on them, rembember it is you, the CEO that put them in charge so their failure is yours as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>If you want to innovate you need to be able to change direction in an instant. Maybe not your whole orginization but definitly those of you tasked with innovating need to be ready. Small cross dicipline teams are best suited to manuver the everchanging market landscape.</p>
