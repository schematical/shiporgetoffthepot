<p>How do you ensure the senior level technicians are teaching their aprintists what you want them to teach? You can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t.
At the end of most chapters I will tell you how to keep a little control and structure after giving up so much earlier in the chaptor.</p>
<p>Another form of institution that has evolved over the centuries is the Guild. A group of craftsmen get together to compair notes, share ideas and further their own abilities. Their focus is extreamly niche.</p>
<p>Typically there is an elder or group of elders that have risen to the top of their craft that the other craftsmen, both senior and junior, look up to. When a junior level or aprentist technician needs help they can look to the senior level technician, but when the senior level technician needs assistance then they can go to the elders. The high level technicians are not required to consult with the elder to make their decisions. They still free to make thier own decisions so they can run their own shop.</p>
<p>If for some reason a particular high level technican fails to produce quality services or is proving incompetitant the elder can suspend their membership or otherwise intervine. This ensures the guilds reputation to the public.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment if nothing in the kingdom happened with out the king&#39;s say so. In order for something to get built the king himself would dictate the exact specifications to his scribe that would take down in cairful detail and jot it down on his peace of parchment. That parchment would then be delivered to the guild of blacksmiths to be carried out to the word. Keep in mind that neither the king nor his scribe have put in the tens of thousands of hours to become master blacksmiths.</p>
<p>Now lets imagine another kingdom things where the Craftsmen are free to work on what they like. Yes, if the king calls you to his service you drop everything and answer the call but on a day to day basis they are allowed to operate attonimously.</p>
<p>An indeidual member of the Blacksmith&#39; Guild might end up partnering with artisans guild and to build statue or perhaps they might partner with the actors guild to help build cosumes for a play.</p>
<p>Which kingdom would you rather serve in? Or lead for that matter? The first kingdom never has to worry about blacksmiths going out and building something that would hurt the kingdoms reputation but there would be no cultural, technological, or financial innovations.</p>
<p>In the second kingdom where the craftsmen are offerd atonomy and encourage to partner wtih craftsmen from other diciplines
This type of atonomy allows for the amazing cultural, technical advances we have seen in civilazations throughout history.</p>
<p>//TODO: Make that make sense</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-actually-apply-to-the-real-world">How does this actually apply to the real world:</h2>
<p>You probablly thought I was going to go all Game of Throwns but I do have a point. It is not uncommon in modern orginizations of a certain size to see instructions handed down from the top in an older waterfall fashion.</p>
<h3 id="each-dicipline-is-its-own-guild">Each dicipline is its own guild:</h3>
<p>Each dicipline inside of your orginization is like its own guild. Individuals would still spend the vast majority working tightly with their objective focused cross diciplined teams but 1/2 a day everymonth would be reserved for everyone to gather by dicipline.</p>
<p>During this dicipline wide meeiting they would catch each other up on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developments in their projects.</li>
<li>Emerging Technologies, Techniques</li>
<li>Learning oppertunities</li>
<li>Team needs(We are looking for a junior developer to move up to another group).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directors">Directors:</h3>
<p>Each dicipline would have an &#39;Elder&#39; or in real world terms the director of a dicipline. Director of Technology, Design lead, Chief Marketing Officer; what ever your title format of choice is. As you grow this might be a group of people that forms a commitie but don&#39;t rush to that. Commitie thinking is a dangerious thing. The director/elder&#39;s responsibilities would be as follows.</p>
<h4 id="set-standsards-and-best-pratices">Set standsards and best pratices:</h4>
<p>One of the risks of having small groups with the authority to make their own decisions is that they might make each make different decisions.</p>
<p>What if each team decided to use different programming languages? Managing such divergent codebase would be near impossible.</p>
<p>What if each team decided to use a different basic color scheme? The users of your products would be confused everytime they visit a different section of your product sweet.</p>
<p>The directors would set some standards and best pratices. It is important for them to make clear which rules are &#39;laws&#39; to be followed or else... and which rules are more like guidlines. I would recomend making more guidelines and less laws whenever possible. Laws stiful creativity and your teams ability to innovate.</p>
<h4 id="provide-learning-expirences">Provide Learning Expirences:</h4>
<p>One of the primary functions of the directors is to share their own expirences and create ways for everyone in their dicipline to gain more knowladge and expirence. Scheduling speakers, hackathons, and other events that facilitate learning will be a big part of this persons job.</p>
<h5 id="learning-from-the-bottom-up">Learning from the bottom up:</h5>
<p>Ideally your directors would have the forsight to take a lession from the young passionate people in the orginization. If they hear of a junior level technican working with a new technology they would hopefully evaluate it. If the technology could be of value they might have that junior level developer present it to the group so the group could benifit from that knowladge.</p>
<p>This also has the side value of making the above menitoned junior level developer feel valued and their fore happier in their job.</p>
<h4 id="recomendations">Recomendations:</h4>
<p>A big responsibility of a director will be making recomendations to the king.</p>
<p>A director might help verify the feesability of proposials for different innovations. They might point out oversights where a proposial missed an important required resource.</p>
<p>The director would be responsible for helping to fill roles on a team. For example a team with graphic design needs would go to the design director who would make a recomendation based off of their available talent.</p>
<p>A junior level developer that has shared a side project might be considdered above a higher level technician that has missed a number of educational oppertunities. It would be upto the director to use their best judgement.</p>
<h4 id="not-work-on-projects">Not work on projects:</h4>
<p>Depening on the size of your orginization your Directors would most likely spend so much time managing their guild that you might want to try and phase them out of the day to day grind.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-tip-fire-drill">Real world tip: Fire Drill</h2>
<p>One of the down sides of having small teams is a lack of redundancy. What happens if someone &quot;Gets hit by a bus&quot;? This can mean a couple of things: leaves for anther job; gets mad and quits; or litterally death or dismemberment. It will happen at some point. How can you minimize the risks involved in not having this type of redundancy.</p>
<p>Those above mentioned standards and education oppertunities will help you combat this by ensuring your technicians all are on the same page generally speaking. This only protects you so much. If you want to be ready for potentially devistating change then you must drill for it.</p>
<h3 id="fire-drills">Fire Drills:</h3>
<p>I recomend instead of just waiting around to see what devistation unfolds when a team member abruplty is taken out of the equasion is to drill for it. Run what I call fire drills. Without warning walk through your work space one monday and start grabing one or two people at random from each team. These people have been &#39;hit by a bus&#39; and will not be avaible for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Your team&#39;s will need to come together to make up for the lost resources. They will have to share what is left of their workforce. They will have to come up with creative ways to work around the problems you have put in front of them. Remember it is not the strongest, the fastest or the smartest that survive; it is those most adaptable to change.</p>
<p>Not all teams will be able to keep up and that is okay. You will at least know how bad it will be when a team member drops and they will be forced to think about prepairing for the worst. I recomend offering a little bonus to any team able to complete their aloted work with this interuption.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-tip-2-project-managers-guild">Real World Tip 2: Project Managers Guild</h2>
<p>//TODO: Might remove this
Having your project managment systems and tequniques standardized will help you at the top keep a good eye on things. The project manager is your main way of tracking timelines as the various projects move.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The guild model that has evolved since the castles of old can help your teams grow and thrive even in these modern times.</p>
