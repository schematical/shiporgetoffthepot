# Important Concepts:
Before I continue there are a couple of concepts that you should be familiar with:

##Build, Measure, Learn:
This is a concept coined in [The Lean Startup by Eric Rise](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898). This is the process of building a down and dirty experimental or prototype, exposing it to customers and getting feedback, then using that feedback to build a better product. This process is repeated over and over again until you have a polished product.

##Early Adopters:
Every product has a lifecycle. At different points different groups of customers are ready to interact with it. If your product is to new and raw it might scare some of the customers away. Some customers thrive on new features and want the latest and greatest. Some might not even care that the product isn't quite polished. Those are your early adopters.

As we proceed I will discuss tips and tricks for getting feedback from your early adopters quickly so you can craft a better product while shielding everyone else from the raw product.

A great book on the topic is [Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore](http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123)
