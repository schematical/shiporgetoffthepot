# The Paint By Numbers Mentality
The orginizations I am talking about in this book have all surpased [Dunbar's Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number). Dunbar's Number is an approximation of the limit of the number of people one can maintain stable social relationships with. This is the number of people in your orginization before there are complete strangers working for you.

Since hiring and training a team of employees that surpases Dunbar's Number is a difficult task the middle and senior management often  draft incredibly long textbooks and training materials that each employee must follow in order to do their jobs.

While a certain amount of documentation is a very good thing, if you over document and tell the employees how to do every detail of their job then you decrease their creativity and likeness
 to solve problems on their own in a creative way. This is an innovation killer. You and a senior management might walk in to a meeting with your employees and see that there is some really obvious problem going on and when you ask why no one has fixed it their reply will be "because there was nothing in the manual about it".

Completely top down documentation is not a good thing either. I mean the manuals created by the lieutenants far away from the front line of your business. Or worse yet some ivy league graduate middle management that has never even seen the front line.

Now don't get me wrong, if you have ever read [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000) then you know the importances of checklists in certain life or death settings. But if no one's life is on the line is it really necessary?

##Asking Permission:

##Asking Forgivness:



##Conclusion:
Giving your employees a 1,2,3 process and punishing them for stepping outside of the processes set forth is a sure way to instill the uncreative paint by numbers approach that kills innovation. It also shows how little you trust to think for themselves those in your command which is a huge moral killer.
