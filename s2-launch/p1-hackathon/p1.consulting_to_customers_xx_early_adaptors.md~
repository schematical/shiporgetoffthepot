So if you have been listening to my advice on validation you know you are going to need alot of feedback to guide the product building process. How do you get that feedback? One way I have found helpful is consulting. Find a potential customer and offer to do what ever the product you are thinking will do by hand. For example I spent a long time building Facebook apps manually before I decided to build a tool that allows others to build Facebook apps quickly and easily.

##The tough part:
Once you have a client or two this is pretty simple. Figure out what the customer finds most valuable and make it into a product. The tough part is finding the clients. I was fortunate to have a viral-esc spread of my reputation after accidentally falling into building my first high profile Facebook App. Its not always that easy though. Here are some stratagies that might work for you:
