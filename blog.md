Before Editing:

While Editing:
* Look for comments like "//TODO:" or other areas like that. They are to be addressed. Commonly these are links
* Areas that look like "_NOTE:_" with out the back slashes will remain in. Those are comments for the reader that are a side from the main point.
* Double check all links to ensure they are properly linked. 
* Don't try and write for SEO(Search engine optimization) that is my job.
* Double/tripple check the names of any person, place or thing mentioned in the post
* Make note of any one mentioned or any projects mentioned run by other people. We will want to touch base(in a friendly way) to notify them of our mention of them.(This is a good way to connect with industury influencers)
* Always be on the look out for an area I trailed off during. I bounce around a lot.


After a blog post is edited:
1. Go through and find 2-3 relitive posts on our site
2. Add to the bottom of the page a 'Related Posts' section
3. Add links to the related post using the post's title as the link field.
